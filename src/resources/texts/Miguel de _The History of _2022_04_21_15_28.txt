abandoned in favour of thepresent undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of anew edition of Shelton’s “Don Quixote,” which has now become a somewhatscarce book. There are some—and I confess myself to be one—for whomShelton’s racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that nomodern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Sheltonhad the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation asCervantes; “Don Quixote” had to him a vitality that only a contemporarycould feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantessaw them; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanishof Cervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself mostlikely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in hissaddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under themulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in itspages.But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderatepopularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, nodoubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority.His warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactoryrepresentative of Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was veryhastily made and was never revised by him. It has all the freshness andvigour, but also a full measure of the faults, of a hasty production.It is often very literal—barbarously literal frequently—but just asoften very loose. He had evidently a good colloquial knowledge ofSpanish, but apparently not much more. It never seems to occur to himthat the same translation of a word will not suit in every case.It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of “DonQuixote.” To those who are familiar with the original, it savours oftruism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughlysatisfactory translation of “Don Quixote” into English or any otherlanguage. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterlyunmanageable, or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough nodoubt, are so superabundant, but rather that the sententious tersenessto which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar toSpanish, and can at best be only distantly imitated in any othertongue.The history of our English translations of “Don Quixote” isinstructive. Shelton’s, the first in any language, was made,apparently, about 1608, but not published till 1612. This of course wasonly the First Part. It has been asserted that the Second, published in1620, is not the work of Shelton, but there is nothing to support theassertion save the fact that it has less spirit, less of what wegenerally understand by “go,” about it than the first, which would beonly natural if the first were the work of a young man writing_currente calamo_, and the second that of a middle-aged man writing fora bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer and more literal, thestyle is the same, the very same translations, or mistranslations,occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would,by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry off the credit.In 1687 John Phillips, Milton’s nephew, produced a “Don Quixote” “madeEnglish,” he says, “according to the humour of our modern language.”His “Quixote” is not so much a translation as a travesty, and atravesty that for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almostunexampled even in the literature of that day.Ned Ward’s “Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrilytranslated into Hudibrastic Verse” (1700), can scarcely be reckoned atranslation, but it serves to show the light in which “Don Quixote” wasregarded at the time.A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 byPeter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing withliterature. It is described as “translated from the original by severalhands,” but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under themanipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on theother hand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares itcarefully with the original will have little doubt that it is aconcoction from Shelton and the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, ekedout by borrowings from Phillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. Itis, to be sure, more decent and decorous, but it treats “Don Quixote”in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic.To attempt to improve the humour of “Don Quixote” by an infusion ofcockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux’s operators did, is notmerely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but anabsolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof ofthe uncritical way in which “Don Quixote” is generally read that thisworse than worthless translation—worthless as failing to represent,worse than worthless as misrepresenting—should have been favoured as ithas been.It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertakenand executed in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, theportrait painter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervashas been allowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be saidnone, for it is known to the world in general as Jarvis’s. It was notpublished until after his death, and the printers gave the nameaccording to the current pronunciation of the day. It has been the mostfreely used and the most freely abused of all the translations. It hasseen far more editions than any other, it is admitted on all hands tobe by far the most faithful, and yet nobody seems to have a good wordto say for it or for its author. Jervas no doubt prejudiced readersagainst himself in his preface, where among many true words aboutShelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and unjustly charges Sheltonwith having translated not from the Spanish, but from the Italianversion of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten years afterShelton’s first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too, seems to haveattached to him because he was by profession a painter and a mediocreone (though he has given us the best portrait we have of Swift), andthis may have been strengthened by Pope’s remark that he “translated‘Don Quixote’ without understanding Spanish.” He has been also chargedwith borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true that in afew difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and goneastray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty wherehe is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope’s dictum, anyone whoexamines Jervas’s version carefully, side by side with the original,will see that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better onethan Shelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, infact, an honest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has lefta version which, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly freefrom errors and mistranslations.The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry—“wooden” in a word,—andno one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may bepleaded for Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to hisabhorrence of the light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. Hewas one of the few, very few, translators that have shown anyapprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotichumour; it seemed to him a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirkingand grinning at his own good things, and to this may be attributed in agreat measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring ofliveliness which is the characteristic of his translation. In mostmodern editions, it should be observed, his style has been smoothed andsmartened, but without any reference to the original Spanish, so thatif he has been made to read more agreeably he has also been robbed ofhis chief merit of fidelity.Smollett’s version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one ofthese. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas’stranslation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably noheed given to the original Spanish.The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly’s,which appeared in 1769, “printed for the Translator,” was an impudentimposture, being nothing more than Motteux’s version with a few of thewords, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot’s (1774) wasonly an abridgment like Florian’s, but not so skilfully executed; andthe version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany herbrother’s plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of formertranslations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield’s, it would be in everysense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had noteven seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and sincethen I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted thetemptation which Mr. Duffield’s reputation and comely volumes hold outto every lover of Cervantes.From the foregoing history of our translations of “Don Quixote,” itwill be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they getthe mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, andadventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care verylittle whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originallyshaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are manywho desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as hetells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstancespermit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator,even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes;there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please theother, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat “Don Quixote”with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptableeven to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous oldjest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if itis, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by whichCervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, tobe equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At anyrate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference,fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator’s duty asfidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much thebetter; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithfula representation of his author as it is in his power to give them,faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful tothe spirit so far as he can make it.My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but toindicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of myability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,cannot be too rigidly followed in translating “Don Quixote,” is toavoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is,indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it morethan Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to useantiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all anaffectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanishhas probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century thanany language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the bestpart of “Don Quixote” differs but little in language from thecolloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and DonQuixote’s speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainesteveryday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearestto the original.Seeing that the story of “Don Quixote” and all its characters andincidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiaras household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the oldfamiliar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason.Of course a translator who holds that “Don Quixote” should receive thetreatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by theinjunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or addanything.CERVANTESFour generations had laughed over “Don Quixote” before it occurred toanyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de CervantesSaavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for asatisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a lifeof the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret’sinstance in 1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had bythat time disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once haveexisted, transmitted from men who had known him, had long since diedout, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries were incurious as to “the men of the time,” areproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself,if it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans ySiscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followedhim, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the fewallusions Cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with suchpieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they couldfind.This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such goodpurpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is thechief characteristic of Navarrete’s work. Besides sifting, testing, andmethodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previouslybrought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned underwhich anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found.Navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is nofault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says ofShakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes:“It is not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, orthe orthography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, norecord of his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by acontemporary has been produced.”It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes,forced to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely toconjecture, and that conjecture should in some instances come bydegrees to take the place of established fact. All that I propose to dohere is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter ofconjecture, and leave it to the reader’s judgment to decide whether thedata justify the inference or not.The men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank ofSpanish literature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon,Garcilaso de la Vega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancientfamilies, and, curiously, all, except the last, of families that tracedtheir origin to the same mountain district in the North of Spain. Thefamily of Cervantes is commonly said to have been of Galician origin,and unquestionably it was in possession of lands in Galicia at a veryearly date; but I think the balance of the evidence tends to show thatthe “solar,” the original site of the family, was at Cervatos in thenorth-west corner of Old Castile, close to the junction of Castile,Leon, and the Asturias. As it happens, there is a complete history ofthe Cervantes family from the tenth century down to the seventeenthextant under the title of “Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, andNoble Posterity of the Famous Nuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,” writtenin 1648 by the industrious genealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, whoavailed himself of a manuscript genealogy by Juan de Mena, the poetlaureate and historiographer of John II.The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost asdistinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of AlfonsoVII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI,and was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood ofToledo. On one of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, hebuilt himself a castle which he called Cervatos, because “he was lordof the solar of Cervatos in the Montana,” as the mountain regionextending from the Basque Provinces to Leon was always called. At hisdeath in battle in 1143, the castle passed by his will to his sonAlfonso Munio, who, as territorial or local surnames were then cominginto vogue in place of the simple patronymic, took the additional nameof Cervatos. His eldest son Pedro succeeded him in the possession ofthe castle, and followed his example in adopting the name, anassumption at which the younger son, Gonzalo, seems to have takenumbrage.Everyone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember theruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge ofAlcántara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline andcrumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solidAlcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It wasbuilt, or as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after hisoccupation of Toledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after aSpanish martyr, a name subsequently modified into San Servan (in whichform it appears in the “Poem of the Cid”), San Servantes, and SanCervantes: with regard to which last the “Handbook for Spain” warns itsreaders against the supposition that it has anything to do with theauthor of “Don Quixote.” Ford, as all know who have taken him for acompanion and counsellor on the roads of Spain, is seldom wrong inmatters of literature or history. In this instance, however, he is inerror. It has everything to do with the author of “Don Quixote,” for itis in fact these old walls that have given to Spain the name she isproudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above mentioned, it may be readilyconceived, did not relish the appropriation by his brother of a name towhich he himself had an equal right, for though nominally taken fromthe castle, it was in reality derived from the ancient territorialpossession of the family, and as a set-off, and to distinguish himself(diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a surname the name of thecastle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building of which, according toa family tradition, his great-grandfather had a share.Both brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity;it sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura,Galicia, and Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguishedin the service of Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently ason of his, followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48that gave Cordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up theMoors in the kingdom of Granada, and his descendants intermarried withsome of the noblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among themsoldiers, magistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least twocardinal-archbishops.Of the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander ofthe Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Ariasde Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez,Corregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branchesof the family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Doña Leonorde Cortinas, and by her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, andMiguel, our author.The pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on “Don Quixote.”A man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errantextending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada waslikely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry ofthe romances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than oneplace about families that have once been great and have tapered awayuntil they have come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of hisown.He was born at Alcalá de Henares and baptised in the church of SantaMaria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth weknow nothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the prefaceto his “Comedies” of himself as a boy looking on with delight whileLope de Rueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in theplaza and acted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took asthe model of his interludes. This first glimpse, however, is asignificant one, for it shows the early development of that love of thedrama which exercised such an influence on his life and seems to havegrown stronger as he grew older, and of which this very preface,written only a few months before his death, is such a striking proof.He gives us to understand, too, that he was a great reader in hisyouth; but of this no assurance was needed, for the First Part of “DonQuixote” alone proves a vast amount of miscellaneous reading, romancesof chivalry, ballads, popular poetry, chronicles, for which he had notime or opportunity except in the first twenty years of his life; andhis misquotations and mistakes in matters of detail are always, it maybe noticed, those of a man recalling the reading of his boyhood.Other things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes wasa boy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition periodfor Spain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain wasthe mightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and ithad not yet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By thepolicy of Ferdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute,and the Church and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. Thenobles, who had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they hadfought the Moors, had been divested of all political power, a like fatehad befallen the cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragonhad been swept away, and the only function that remained to the Cortéswas that of granting money at the King’s dictation.The transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de laVega and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, hadbrought back from Italy the products of the post-Renaissanceliterature, which took root and flourished and even threatened toextinguish the native growths. Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe hadbeen fairly naturalised in Spain, together with all the devices ofpastoral poetry for investing with an air of novelty the idea of adispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess. As a set-off againstthis, the old historical and traditional ballads, and the truepastorals, the songs and ballads of peasant life, were being collectedassiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded one anotherwith increasing rapidity. But the most notable consequence, perhaps, ofthe spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalry that hadcontinued to pour from the press ever since Garci Ordoñez de Montalvohad resuscitated “Amadis of Gaul” at the beginning of the century.For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been nobetter spot in Spain than Alcalá de Henares in the middle of thesixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,something more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogethera very different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcalá thetraveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology andmedicine may have been the strong points of the university, but thetown itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and lightliterature, and as a producer of books Alcalá was already beginning tocompete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca andSeville.A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoingsmight, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcalá at thattime; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop wherethe latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be,what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,that called itself “Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,”could be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at oneof those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageouspanoply and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances lovedto embellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the fatherof the man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty waslively at ten, and some such reflections as these may have been thetrue genesis of “Don Quixote.”For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. Butwhy Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his sonto a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at hisown door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that hedid so. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor TomasGonzalez, that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of aMiguel de Cervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again;but even if it had, and if the date corresponded, it would provenothing, as there were at least two other Miguels born about the middleof the century; one of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin,no doubt, who was a source of great embarrassment to the biographers.That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcalá is best provedby his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,and he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life—for the“Tia Fingida,” if it be his, is not one—nothing, not even “a collegejoke,” to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. Allthat we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez deHoyos, a professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence,calls him his “dear and beloved pupil.” This was in a little collectionof verses by different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, secondqueen of Philip II., published by the professor in 1569, to whichCervantes contributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaphin the form of a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a “Lycidas”finds its way into a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton.His verses are no worse than such things usually are; so much, atleast, may be said for them.By the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate orderedit, for twelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio,afterwards Cardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 toPhilip II. by the Pope on a mission, partly of condolence, partlypolitical, and on his return to Rome, which was somewhat brusquelyexpedited by the King, he took Cervantes with him as his camarero(chamberlain), the office he himself held in the Pope’s household. Thepost would no doubt have led to advancement at the Papal Court hadCervantes retained it, but in the summer of 1570 he resigned it andenlisted as a private soldier in Captain Diego Urbina’s company,belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada’s regiment, but at that time forminga part of the command of Marc Antony Colonna. What impelled him to thisstep we know not, whether it was distaste for the career before him, orpurely military enthusiasm. It may well have been the latter, for itwas a stirring time; the events, however, which led to the alliancebetween Spain, Venice, and the Pope, against the common enemy, thePorte, and to the victory of the combined fleets at Lepanto, belongrather to the history of Europe than to the life of Cervantes. He wasone of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571, under thecommand of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th ofOctober, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was lying below illwith fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he rose, and, inspite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors, insisted ontaking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of God andthe King to health. His galley, the _Marquesa_, was in the thick of thefight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds, twoin the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after thebattle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with thecommander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection ofthe wounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to hispay, and another, apparently, the friendship of his general.How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, thatwith youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperamentas ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina beforehe was discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled;he had lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the “Viaje delParnaso” for the greater glory of the right. This, however, did notabsolutely unfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined ManuelPonce de Leon’s company of Lope de Figueroa’s regiment, in which, itseems probable, his brother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in theoperations of the next three years, including the capture of theGoletta and Tunis. Taking advantage of the lull which followed therecapture of these places by the Turks, he obtained leave to return toSpain, and sailed from Naples in September 1575 on board the _Sun_galley, in company with his brother Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada,late Governor of the Goletta, and some others, and furnished withletters from Don John of Austria and the Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy ofSicily, recommending him to the King for the command of a company, onaccount of his services; a _dono infelice_ as events proved. On the26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine galleys, and after astout resistance were overpowered and carried into Algiers.By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to informtheir family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcalá at oncestrove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all hepossessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. ButDali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King byDon John and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be aperson of great consequence, when the money came he refused itscornfully as being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo,however, was more easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case,and it was arranged between the brothers that he should return to Spainand procure a vessel in which he was to come back to Algiers and takeoff Miguel and as many of their comrades as possible. This was not thefirst attempt to escape that Cervantes had made. Soon after thecommencement of his captivity he induced several of his companions tojoin him in trying to reach Oran, then a Spanish post, on foot; butafter the first day’s journey, the Moor who had agreed to act as theirguide deserted them, and they had no choice but to return. The secondattempt was more disastrous. In a garden outside the city on thesea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the gardener, a Spaniard, ahiding-place, to which he brought, one by one, fourteen of hisfellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for several months, andsupplying them with food through a renegade known as El Dorador, “theGilder.” How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all this, is one ofthe mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may appear, it was verynearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo made its appearanceoff the coast, and under cover of night was proceeding to take off therefugees, when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat, andbeat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt shortly afterwards, they,or a portion of them at least, were taken prisoners, and just as thepoor fellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a fewmoments more freedom would be within their grasp, they found themselvessurrounded by Turkish troops, horse and foot. The Dorador had revealedthe whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions tolay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declaredaloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody elsehad any share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He wasthreatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off earsand noses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceivedwhat their tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve fromhis original statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshotwas that the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and theprisoners taken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwardsrestored most of them to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying DaliMami 500 crowns for him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of suchresource, energy, and daring, was too dangerous a piece of property tobe left in private hands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged inhis own prison. If he thought that by these means he could break thespirit or shake the resolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived,for Cervantes contrived before long to despatch a letter to theGovernor of Oran, entreating him to send him someone that could betrusted, to enable him and three other gentlemen, fellow-captives ofhis, to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his firstattempt with a more trustworthy guide. Unfortunately the Moor whocarried the letter was stopped just outside Oran, and the letter beingfound upon him, he was sent back to Algiers, where by the order of theDey he was promptly impaled as a warning to others, while Cervantes wascondemned to receive two thousand blows of the stick, a number whichmost likely would have deprived the world of “Don Quixote,” had notsome persons, who they were we know not, interceded on his behalf.After this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement thanbefore, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt.This time his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegadeand two Valencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel inwhich he and about sixty of the leading captives were to make theirescape; but just as they were about to put it into execution one DoctorJuan Blanco de Paz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Deyof the plot. Cervantes by force of character, by his self-devotion, byhis untiring energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of hiscompanions in misery, had endeared himself to all, and become theleading spirit in the captive colony, and, incredible as it may seem,jealousy of his influence and the esteem in which he was held, movedthis man to compass his destruction by a cruel death. The merchantsfinding that the Dey knew all, and fearing that Cervantes under torturemight make disclosures that would imperil their own lives, tried topersuade him to slip away on board a vessel that was on the point ofsailing for Spain; but he told them they had nothing to fear, for notortures would make him compromise anybody, and he went at once andgave himself up to the Dey.As before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices.Everything was made ready for his immediate execution; the halter wasput round his neck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could begot from him was that he himself, with the help of four gentlemen whohad since left Algiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty whowere to accompany him were not to know anything of it until the lastmoment. Finding he could make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back toprison more heavily ironed than before.The poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time tryingonce more to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundredducats was got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father JuanGil, who was about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded morethan double the sum offered, and as his term of office had expired andhe was about to sail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves withhim, the case of Cervantes was critical. He was already on boardheavily ironed, when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand byone-half, and Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount,and on September 19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but aweek, Cervantes was at last set free. Before long he discovered thatBlanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was nowconcocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be broughtagainst him on his return to Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew upa series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of hiscaptivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to take the depositionsof credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnesses taken fromamong the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts abovestated and to a great deal more besides. There is something touching inthe admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to findexpression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify oneafter another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted andhelped the weak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how heshared his poor purse with this deponent, and how “in him this deponentfound father and mother.”On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march forPortugal to support Philip’s claim to the crown, and utterly pennilessnow, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to theAzores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the warreturned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him themanuscript of his pastoral romance, the “Galatea,” and probably also,to judge by internal evidence, that of the first portion of “Persilesand Sigismunda.” He also brought back with him, his biographers assert,an infant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them withgreat circumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth,whose name, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, theyomit to mention. The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 therecertainly was living in the family of Cervantes a Doña Isabel deSaavedra, who is described in an official document as his naturaldaughter, and then twenty years of age.With his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, nowthat Don John was dead and he had no one to press his claims andservices, and for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was adismal prospect; he had already a certain reputation as a poet; he madeup his mind, therefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for afirst venture committed his “Galatea” to the press. It was published,as Salva y Mallen shows conclusively, at Alcalá, his own birth-place,in 1585 and no doubt helped to make his name more widely known, butcertainly did not do him much good in any other way.While it was going through the press, he married Doña Catalina dePalacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, andapparently a friend of the family, who brought him a fortune which maypossibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, thatwas all. The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages andstrolling companies, and with his old love for it he naturally turnedto it for a congenial employment. In about three years he wrote twentyor thirty plays, which he tells us were performed without any throwingof cucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without anyhisses, outcries, or disturbance. In other words, his plays were notbad enough to be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to holdtheir own upon it. Only two of them have been preserved, but as theyhappen to be two of the seven or eight he mentions with complacency, wemay assume they are favourable specimens, and no one who reads the“Numancia” and the “Trato de Argel” will feel any surprise that theyfailed as acting dramas. Whatever merits they may have, whateveroccasional they may show, they are, as regards construction, incurablyclumsy. How completely they failed is manifest from the fact that withall his sanguine temperament and indomitable perseverance he was unableto maintain the struggle to gain a livelihood as a dramatist for morethan three years; nor was the rising popularity of Lope the cause, asis often said, notwithstanding his own words to the contrary. When Lopebegan to write for the stage is uncertain, but it was certainly afterCervantes went to Seville.Among the “Nuevos Documentos” printed by Señor Asensio y Toledo is onedated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is anagreement with one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept sixcomedies at fifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any caseunless it appeared on representation that the said comedy was one ofthe best that had ever been represented in Spain. The test does notseem to have been ever applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent toRodrigo Osorio that the comedies were not among the best that had everbeen represented. Among the correspondence of Cervantes there mighthave been found, no doubt, more than one letter like that we see in the“Rake’s Progress,” “Sir, I have read your play, and it will not doo.”He was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 inhonour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won thefirst prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had beenappointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada. In orderto remit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury,he entrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as thebankrupt’s assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent toprison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however,was a small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he wasreleased at the end of the year.It was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king’s taxes,that he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and characterthat abound in the pages of “Don Quixote:” the Benedictine monks withspectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers incostume bound for the next village; the barber with his basin on hishead, on his way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches inhis bundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered inthe venta gateway listening to “Felixmarte of Hircania” read out tothem; and those little Hogarthian touches that he so well knew how tobring in, the ox-tail hanging up with the landlord’s comb stuck in it,the wine-skins at the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelryart, Helen going off in high spirits on Paris’s arm, and Dido on thetower dropping tears as big as walnuts. Nay, it may well be that onthose journeys into remote regions he came across now and then aspecimen of the pauper gentleman, with his lean hack and his greyhoundand his books of chivalry, dreaming away his life in happy ignorancethat the world had changed since his great-grandfather’s old helmet wasnew. But it was in Seville that he found out his true vocation, thoughhe himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so. It wasthere, in Triana, that he was first tempted to try his hand at drawingfrom life, and first brought his humour into play in the exquisitelittle sketch of “Rinconete y Cortadillo,” the germ, in more ways thanone, of “Don Quixote.”Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonmentall trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from whichit may be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still inSeville in November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on theelaborate catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at thedeath of Philip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to hismovements. The words in the preface to the First Part of “Don Quixote”are generally held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of thebook, and wrote the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that hemay have done so is extremely likely.There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to aselect audience at the Duke of Bejar’s, which may have helped to makethe book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of“Don Quixote” lay on his hands some time before he could find apublisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character;and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom atlast he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securingthe copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that forCastile. The printing was finished in December, and the book came outwith the new year, 1605. It is often said that “Don Quixote” was atfirst received coldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner wasit in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issuepirated editions at Lisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a secondedition with the additional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal, whichhe secured in February.No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certainsections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination amongthe aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy ingeneral were not likely to relish a book that turned their favouritereading into ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas.The dramatists who gathered round Lope as their leader regardedCervantes as their common enemy, and it is plain that he was equallyobnoxious to the other clique, the culto poets who had Gongora fortheir chief. Navarrete, who knew nothing of the letter above mentioned,tries hard to show that the relations between Cervantes and Lope wereof a very friendly sort, as indeed they were until “Don Quixote” waswritten. Cervantes, indeed, to the last generously and manfullydeclared his admiration of Lope’s powers, his unfailing invention, andhis marvellous fertility; but in the preface of the First Part of “DonQuixote” and in the verses of “Urganda the Unknown,” and one or twoother places, there are, if we read between the lines, sly hits atLope’s vanities and affectations that argue no personal good-will; andLope openly sneers at “Don Quixote” and Cervantes, and fourteen yearsafter his death gives him only a few lines of cold commonplace in the“Laurel de Apolo,” that seem all the colder for the eulogies of a hostof nonentities whose names are found nowhere else.In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginningof 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with thebalance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. Heremained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies andscrivener’s work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawingup statements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like.So, at least, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion ofthe death of a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had beencarried into the house in which he lived. In these he himself isdescribed as a man who wrote and transacted business, and it appearsthat his household then consisted of his wife, the natural daughterIsabel de Saavedra already mentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow,her daughter Constanza, a mysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor callingherself his sister, for whom his biographers cannot account, and aservant-maid.Meanwhile “Don Quixote” had been growing in favour, and its author’sname was now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printedat Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meetthe demand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. Thepopularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller wasled to bring out an edition in 1610; and another was called for inBrussels in 1611. It might naturally have been expected that, with suchproofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervanteswould have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of asecond volume.But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He hadstill by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he hadinserted in “Don Quixote” and instead of continuing the adventures ofDon Quixote, he set to work to write more of these “Novelas Exemplares”as he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication tothe Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of thosechatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eightyears and a half after the First Part of “Don Quixote” had appeared, weget the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. “You shall seeshortly,” he says, “the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours ofSancho Panza.” His idea of “shortly” was a somewhat elastic one, for,as we know by the date to Sancho’s letter, he had barely one-half ofthe book completed that time twelvemonth.But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramaticambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit thatkept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him toattempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, madehim persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts towin the ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervanteswas essentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to thenovels, with the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubledforehead, and bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguineman. Nothing that the managers might say could persuade him that themerits of his plays would not be recognised at last if they were onlygiven a fair chance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent onbeing the Aeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama,based on the true principles of art, that was to be the envy of allnations; he was to drive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the“mirrors of nonsense and models of folly” that were in vogue throughthe cupidity of the managers and shortsightedness of the authors; hewas to correct and educate the public taste until it was ripe fortragedies on the model of the Greek drama—like the “Numancia” forinstance—and comedies that would not only amuse but improve andinstruct. All this he was to do, could he once get a hearing: there wasthe initial difficulty.He shows plainly enough, too, that “Don Quixote” and the demolition ofthe chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,indeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than afather to “Don Quixote.” Never was great work so neglected by itsauthor. That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits andstarts, was not always his fault, but it seems clear he never read whathe sent to the press. He knew how the printers had blundered, but henever took the trouble to correct them when the third edition was inprogress, as a man who really cared for the child of his brain wouldhave done. He appears to have regarded the book as little more than amere libro de entretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he says inthe “Viaje,” “to divert the melancholy moody heart at any time orseason.” No doubt he had an affection for his hero, and was very proudof Sancho Panza. It would have been strange indeed if he had not beenproud of the most humorous creation in all fiction. He was proud, too,of the popularity and success of the book, and beyond measuredelightful is the naivete with which he shows his pride in a dozenpassages in the Second Part. But it was not the success he coveted. Inall probability he would have given all the success of “Don Quixote,”nay, would have seen every copy of “Don Quixote” burned in the PlazaMayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega was enjoying on an averageonce a week.And so he went on, dawdling over “Don Quixote,” adding a chapter nowand again, and putting it aside to turn to “Persiles andSigismunda”—which, as we know, was to be the most entertaining book inthe language, and the rival of “Theagenes and Chariclea”—or finishingoff one of his darling comedies; and if Robles asked when “Don Quixote”would be ready, the answer no doubt was: En breve—shortly, there wastime enough for that. At sixty-eight he was as full of life and hopeand plans for the future as a boy of eighteen.Nemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which athis leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October orNovember 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave latelyprinted at Tarragona, and calling itself “Second Volume of theIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate AlonsoFernandez de Avellaneda of Tordesillas.” The last half of Chapter LIXand most of the following chapters of the Second Part give us some ideaof the effect produced upon him, and his irritation was not likely tobe lessened by the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself.Had Avellaneda, in fact, been content with merely bringing out acontinuation to “Don Quixote,” Cervantes would have had no reasonablegrievance. His own intentions were expressed in the very vaguestlanguage at the end of the book; nay, in his last words, “forse altrocantera con miglior plettro,” he seems actually to invite someone elseto continue the work, and he made no sign until eight years and a halfhad gone by; by which time Avellaneda’s volume was no doubt written.In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the merecontinuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface toit, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned mancould pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having losthis hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with beingfriendless, accuses him of envy of Lope’s success, of petulance andquerulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay.Avellaneda’s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoeverhe may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists ofLope’s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes withattacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. Hisidentification has exercised the best critics and baffled all theingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarreteand Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was;but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisibleassailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito inthe dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces himto be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports thisview and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, aDominican probably.Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is toodull to reflect much. “Dull and dirty” will always be, I imagine, theverdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, apoor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead givenhim by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take innsfor castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage,and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony;all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he hascontrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by thesixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.But whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget thedebt we owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, “Don Quixote”would have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even ifCervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly hewould have left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the furtheradventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. Itis plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with thepastoral romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and butfor Avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is morelikely that, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volumewould have remained unfinished till his death, and that we should havenever made the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone withSancho to Barataria.From the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have beenhaunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field,and putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off histask and protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him.The conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece ofwork and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered toAvellaneda becomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate,a conclusion and for that we must thank Avellaneda.The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printedtill the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes puttogether the comedies and interludes he had written within the last fewyears, and, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among themanagers, and published them with a preface, worth the book itintroduces tenfold, in which he gives an account of the early Spanishstage, and of his own attempts as a dramatist. It is needless to saythey were put forward by Cervantes in all good faith and fullconfidence in their merits. The reader, however, was not to supposethey were his last word or final effort in the drama, for he had inhand a comedy called “Engano a los ojos,” about which, if he mistooknot, there would be no question.Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging;his health had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently ofdropsy, on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lostShakespeare, nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yetbeen reformed. He died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely andcheerfully.Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell usthat it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life ofpoverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment,but Cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils.His was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merelyby virtue of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a highspirit that he was proof against it. It is impossible to conceiveCervantes giving way to despondency or prostrated by dejection. As forpoverty, it was with him a thing to be laughed over, and the only sighhe ever allows to escape him is when he says, “Happy he to whom Heavenhas given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to give thanks toany but Heaven itself.” Add to all this his vital energy and mentalactivity, his restless invention and his sanguine temperament, andthere will be reason enough to doubt whether his could have been a veryunhappy life. He who could take Cervantes’ distresses together with hisapparatus for enduring them would not make so bad a bargain, perhaps,as far as happiness in life is concerned.Of his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, inaccordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitariannuns, of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was aninmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to anotherconvent, carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains ofCervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and theclue to their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishesperhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglectbrought against his contemporaries. In some of the others there is agood deal of exaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers onewould suppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man butagainst his memory, or at least that it was insensible to his merits,and left him to live in misery and die of want. To talk of his hardlife and unworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he doneto distinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning aprecarious livelihood? True, he was a gallant soldier, who had beenwounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his country’scause, but there were hundreds of others in the same case. He hadwritten a mediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and someplays which manifestly did not comply with the primary condition ofpleasing: were the playgoers to patronise plays that did not amusethem, because the author was to produce “Don Quixote” twenty yearsafterwards?The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately onthe appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility toits merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a manwrites a book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account withbeing coldly received by the periwig wearers and hated by the wholetribe of wigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, thesentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period allagainst him, it was because “Don Quixote” was what it was; and if thegeneral public did not come forward to make him comfortable for therest of his days, it is no more to be charged with neglect andingratitude than the English-speaking public that did not pay offScott’s liabilities. It did the best it could; it read his book andliked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller to pay him wellfor others.It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected nomonument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, ofhim; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de lasCortés, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it beenset up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town,is not worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of“such weak witness of his name;” or what could a monument do in hiscase except testify to the self-glorification of those who had put itup? Si monumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller’s shopwill show what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of“Don Quixote.”‘DON QUIXOTE’Nine editions of the First Part of “Don Quixote” had already appearedbefore Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to hisown estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after hisdeath. So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time,but by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time downto the present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidlyand regularly. The translations show still more clearly in what requestthe book has been from the very outset. In seven years from thecompletion of the work it had been translated into the four leadinglanguages of Europe. Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been sowidely diffused as “Don Quixote.” The “Imitatio Christi” may have beentranslated into as many different languages, and perhaps “RobinsonCrusoe” and the “Vicar of Wakefield” into nearly as many, but inmultiplicity of translations and editions “Don Quixote” leaves them allfar behind.Still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. “DonQuixote” has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas aboutknight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who hadnever seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feelthe humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author’s purpose.Another curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in theworld, is one of the most intensely national. “Manon Lescaut” is notmore thoroughly French, “Tom Jones” not more English, “Rob Roy” notmore Scotch, than “Don Quixote” is Spanish, in character, in ideas, insentiment, in local colour, in everything. What, then, is the secret ofthis unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nighthree centuries? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books inthe world, “Don Quixote” is the most catholic. There is something in itfor every sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. AsCervantes himself says with a touch of pride, “It is thumbed and readand got by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves,the young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folkpraise it.”But it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than itshumour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge ofhuman nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude,is the vein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon thesheep, the battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino’s helmet, the balsam ofFierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill,Sancho tossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of masterand man, that were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are sostill to some extent with the majority of readers. It is plain that“Don Quixote” was generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain fora long time, as little more than a queer droll book, full of laughableincidents and absurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to muchconsideration or care. All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to1771, when the famous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere tradeeditions, badly and carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in thestyle of chap-books intended only for popular use, with, in mostinstances, uncouth illustrations and clap-trap additions by thepublisher.To England belongs the credit of having been the first country torecognise the right of “Don Quixote” to better treatment than this. TheLondon edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret’s from havingbeen suggested by him, was not a mere _édition de luxe_. It produced“Don Quixote” in becoming form as regards paper and type, andembellished with plates which, if not particularly happy asillustrations, were at least well intentioned and well executed, but italso aimed at correctness of text, a matter to which nobody except theeditors of the Valencia and Brussels editions had given even a passingthought; and for a first attempt it was fairly successful, for thoughsome of its emendations are inadmissible, a good many of them have beenadopted by all subsequent editors.The zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about aremarkable change of sentiment with regard to “Don Quixote.” A vastnumber of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. Itbecame almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour wasnot entirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as analtogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than thestalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot hisphilosophy or his satire, or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for onthis point opinions varied. All were agreed, however, that the objecthe aimed at was not the books of chivalry. He said emphatically in thepreface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, thathe had no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this,to advanced criticism, made it clear that his object must have beensomething else.One theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth theeternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit ofpoetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy neverevolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of itsinner consciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to befound in “Don Quixote,” because it is to be found everywhere in life,and Cervantes drew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community inwhich the never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza andDon Quixote would not be recognised as true to nature. In the stoneage, among the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were DonQuixotes and Sancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte whonever could see the facts before his eyes, and the troglodyte who couldsee nothing else. But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himselfto expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to supposesomething not only very unlike the age in which he lived, butaltogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first tolaugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else.The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day isquite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of theprodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenthcentury may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the readerbears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by farthe largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation,there is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises andPalmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century,there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character andposition lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalryand the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom tosweep away that dust.That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ampleprovocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those wholook into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalryitself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that,thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is nogreater one than saying that “Cervantes smiled Spain’s chivalry away.”In the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain’schivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done whenGranada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature,it could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for thefree institutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was notchivalry but a degrading mockery of it.The true nature of the “right arm” and the “bright array,” beforewhich, according to the poet, “the world gave ground,” and whichCervantes’ single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words ofone of his own countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by CaptainGeorge Carleton, in his “Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.” “Beforethe appearance in the world of that labour of Cervantes,” he said, “itwas next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with anydelight or without danger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancingand curvetting before the windows of their mistresses, that a strangerwould have imagined the whole nation to have been nothing less than arace of knight-errants. But after the world became a little acquaintedwith that notable history, the man that was seen in that oncecelebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don Quixote, and found himselfthe jest of high and low. And I verily believe that to this, and thisonly, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit which has run throughall our councils for a century past, so little agreeable to thosenobler actions of our famous ancestors.”To call “Don Quixote” a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,argues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moralwere that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridiculeand discomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, sofar as it can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm thatis born of vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, nota means to an end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless ofcircumstances and consequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a veryconsiderable nuisance to the community at large. To those who cannotdistinguish between the one kind and the other, no doubt “Don Quixote”is a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who hadjust uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that “it is a hard case tomake slaves of those whom God and Nature made free,” should beungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had letloose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be amatter of regret that reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm is notoftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in theworld.A very slight examination of the structure of “Don Quixote” willsuffice to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan inhis mind when he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which“with a few strokes of a great master he sets before us the paupergentleman,” he had no idea of the goal to which his imagination wasleading him. There can be little doubt that all he contemplated was ashort tale to range with those he had already written, a tale settingforth the ludicrous results that might be expected to follow theattempt of a crazy gentleman to act the part of a knight-errant inmodern life.It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into theoriginal scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly wouldnot have omitted him in his hero’s outfit, which he obviously meant tobe complete. Him we owe to the landlord’s chance remark in Chapter IIIthat knights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a DonQuixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladedpair of scissors.The story was written at first, like the others, without any divisionand without the intervention of Cid Hamete Benengeli; and it seems notunlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, orAldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransackingof the Don’s library and the discussion on the books of chivalry thatfirst suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development.What, if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were tomake his tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing theirstyle, incidents, and spirit?In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsilydivided what he had written into chapters on the model of “Amadis,”invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up CidHamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of thechivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to somerecondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the valueof Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho’s part, but tothe whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when heannounces his intention of taking his ass with him. “About the ass,” weare told, “Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could callto mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted onass-back; but no instance occurred to his memory.” We can see the wholescene at a glance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and theperplexity of his master, upon whose perception the incongruity hasjust forced itself. This is Sancho’s mission throughout the book; he isan unconscious Mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of hismaster’s aspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by someunintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world offact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, andsummoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,the case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had notmerely found favour, but had already become, what they have never sinceceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There wasno occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, hisreaders told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more DonQuixote and more Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions.To himself, too, his creations had become realities, and he had becomeproud of them, especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part,therefore, under very different conditions, and the difference makesitself manifest at once. Even in translation the style will be seen tobe far easier, more flowing, more natural, and more like that of a mansure of himself and of his audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo achange also. In the First Part, Don Quixote has no character orindividuality whatever. He is nothing more than a crazy representativeof the sentiments of the chivalry romances. In all that he says anddoes he is simply repeating the lesson he has learned from his books;and therefore, it is absurd to speak of him in the gushing strain ofthe sentimental critics when they dilate upon his nobleness,disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth. It was the businessof a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour thedistressed, and this, as a matter of course, he makes his business whenhe takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and sohe feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron’s melodious nonsenseabout Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that “’tis hisvirtue makes him mad!” The exact opposite is the truth; it is hismadness makes him virtuous.In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if itwas a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, thathis hero’s madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject ofchivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of thisis that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece forhis own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himselfthe relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in acommonplace book.It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is notvery great. There are some natural touches of character about him, suchas his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curiousaffection for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire’sloquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, heis little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctivegood taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface tothe First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before hehad been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, takinghim in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve himby making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervanteswas too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when hereappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with adifference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the sametime with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outlinehas been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by afew touches of a master’s hand, Sancho stands before us as he might ina character portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important andprominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it ishis matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent suppliesthe action of the story.His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. Inthe First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies arenot of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonlyindulge in; like Falstaff’s, they resemble the father that begets them;they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. Butin the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, aswe see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcineaand her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by hissuccess in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flightbeyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavileño.In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of thechivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments ofthe sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the caveof Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances,and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote’sblind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is eithera mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded manwould care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes’humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.Like everything else in these romances, it is a gross exaggeration ofthe real sentiment of chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance isprobably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole, theProvencal poets. When a troubadour professed his readiness to obey hislady in all things, he made it incumbent upon the next comer, if hewished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace, to declarehimself the slave of her will, which the next was compelled to cap bysome still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went onrising one above the other like biddings at an auction, and aconventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into beingthat in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe, and borefruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatrice andLaura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponentsin writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes deals within Don Quixote’s passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has hecarried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in thebackground, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose veryexistence we are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote’s worship of hervirtues and charms with an additional extravagance, and gives stillmore point to the caricature of the sentiment and language of theromances.One of the great merits of “Don Quixote,” and one of the qualities thathave secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it themost cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course,points obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience whichdo not immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes oftentakes it for granted that an allusion will be generally understoodwhich is only intelligible to a few. For example, on many of hisreaders in Spain, and most of his readers out of it, the significanceof his choice of a country for his hero is completely lost. It would begoing too far to say that no one can thoroughly comprehend “DonQuixote” without having seen La Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpseof La Mancha will give an insight into the meaning of Cervantes such asno commentator can give. Of all the regions of Spain it is the lastthat would suggest the idea of romance. Of all the dull central plateauof the Peninsula it is the dullest tract. There is something impressiveabout the grim solitudes of Estremadura; and if the plains of Leon andOld Castile are bald and dreary, they are studded with old citiesrenowned in history and rich in relics of the past. But there is noredeeming feature in the Manchegan landscape; it has all the samenessof the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villages thatbreak its monotony are mean and commonplace, there is nothing venerableabout them, they have not even the picturesqueness of poverty; indeed,Don Quixote’s own village, Argamasilla, has a sort of oppressiverespectability in the prim regularity of its streets and houses;everything is ignoble; the very windmills are the ugliest and shabbiestof the windmill kind.To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of “DonQuixote of La Mancha” gave the key to the author’s meaning at once. LaMancha as the knight’s country and scene of his chivalries is of apiece with the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for asquire, knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken forvictims of oppression, and the rest of the incongruities between DonQuixote’s world and the world he lived in, between things as he sawthem and things as they were.It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the wholehumour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded bythe majority of those who have undertaken to interpret “Don Quixote.”It has been completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. Tobe sure, the great majority of the artists who illustrated “DonQuixote” knew nothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed noidea but the abstract one of a roadside inn, and they could nottherefore do full justice to the humour of Don Quixote’s misconceptionin taking it for a castle, or perceive the remoteness of all itsrealities from his ideal. But even when better informed they seem tohave no apprehension of the full force of the discrepancy. Take, forinstance, Gustave Doré’s drawing of Don Quixote watching his armour inthe inn-yard. Whether or not the Venta de Quesada on the Seville roadis, as tradition maintains, the inn described in “Don Quixote,” beyondall question it was just such an inn-yard as the one behind it thatCervantes had in his mind’s eye, and it was on just such a rude stonetrough as that beside the primitive draw-well in the corner that hemeant Don Quixote to deposit his armour. Gustave Doré makes it anelaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in thecorral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the pointaimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace characterof all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance toDon Quixote’s vigil and the ceremony that follows.Cervantes’ humour is for the most part of that broader and simplersort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous.It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, withthe ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderfulvitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the mosthumorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravityof which Cervantes was the first great master, “Cervantes’ seriousair,” which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of laterhumourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here againCervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing,unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out ofplace in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-befacetious style, like that of Motteux’s version for example, or thesprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is thegrave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparentunconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous,anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour tothe humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the exact opposite of thehumour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists. Even when UncleToby is at his best, you are always aware of “the man Sterne” behindhim, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he is producing.Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho. He andSwift and the great humourists always keep themselves out of sight, or,more properly speaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike ourlatter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived the oldhorse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesqueassumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any otherlanguage is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity anda sonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, thatmake an absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the mostpreposterous statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza’s drollery thedespair of the conscientious translator. Sancho’s curt comments cannever fall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred fromtheir native Castilian into any other medium. But if foreigners havefailed to do justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse thanhis own countrymen. Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant’srelish of “Don Quixote,” one might be tempted to think that the greathumourist was not looked upon as a humourist at all in his own country.The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicateditself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the bookand run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their ownimaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget thatscreams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that areinfluenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, andpompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is thatwhile they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner ofimaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception ofthe quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would ratehighest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above allrivalry.To speak of “Don Quixote” as if it were merely a humorous book would bea manifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind ofcommonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for theobservations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirringlife. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.Among modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaboratestudies of character, but there is no book richer in individualisedcharacter. What Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true ofCervantes; he never, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forwarda lay figure. There is life and individuality in all his characters,however little they may have to do, or however short a time they may bebefore the reader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza,Altisidora, even the two students met on the road to the cave ofMontesinos, all live and move and have their being; and it ischaracteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there is not ahateful one among them all. Even poor Maritornes, with her deplorablemorals, has a kind heart of her own and “some faint and distantresemblance to a Christian about her;” and as for Sancho, though ondissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him, unless it be a sortof dog-like affection for his master, who is there that in his heartdoes not love him?But it is, after all, the humour of “Don Quixote” that distinguishes itfrom all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, asone of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, “the bestnovel in the world beyond all comparison.” It is its varied humour,ranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare’s orMolière’s that has naturalised it in every country where there arereaders, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.THE AUTHOR’S PREFACEIdle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would thisbook, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, andcleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature’slaw that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could thissterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry,shrivelled, whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and suchas never came into any other imagination—just what might be begotten ina prison, where every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makesits dwelling? Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, brightskies, murmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that gofar to make even the most barren muses fertile, and bring into theworld births that fill it with wonder and delight. Sometimes when afather has an ugly, loutish son, the love he bears him so blindfoldshis eyes that he does not see his defects, or, rather, takes them forgifts and charms of mind and body, and talks of them to his friends aswit and grace. I, however—for though I pass for the father, I am butthe stepfather to “Don Quixote”—have no desire to go with the currentof custom, or to implore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in myeyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceivein this child of mine. Thou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thysoul is thine own and thy will as free as any man’s, whate’er he be,thou art in thine own house and master of it as much as the king of histaxes and thou knowest the common saying, “Under my cloak I kill theking;” all which exempts and frees thee from every consideration andobligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of the story without fearof being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good thou mayest say ofit.My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customarysonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at thebeginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost mesome labour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thouart now reading. Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and manydid I lay it down again, not knowing what to write. One of these times,as I was pondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbowon the desk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say,there came in unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine,who, seeing me so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, makingno mystery of it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had tomake for the story of “Don Quixote,” which so troubled me that I had amind not to make any at all, nor even publish the achievements of sonoble a knight.“For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what thatancient lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, afterslumbering so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out nowwith all my years upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush,devoid of invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wantingin learning and wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotationsat the end, after the fashion of other books I see, which, though allfables and profanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato,and the whole herd of philosophers, that they fill the readers withamazement and convince them that the authors are men of learning,erudition, and eloquence. And then, when they quote the HolyScriptures!—anyone would say they are St. Thomases or other doctors ofthe Church, observing as they do a decorum so ingenious that in onesentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver adevout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear andread. Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothingto quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I knowwhat authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do,under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending withXenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and theother a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning,at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops,ladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obligingfriends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions ofthose that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal.“In short, my friend,” I continued, “I am determined that Señor DonQuixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha untilHeaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he standsin need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want oflearning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy andcareless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say withoutthem. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reasonenough, what you have heard from me.”Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead andbreaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, “Before God, Brother, now am Idisabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time Ihave known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd andsensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as theheaven is from the earth. Is it possible that things of so littlemoment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit likeyours, fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By myfaith, this comes, not of any want of ability, but of too muchindolence and too little knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I amtelling the truth? Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, inthe opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties,and supply all those deficiencies which you say check and discourageyou from bringing before the world the story of your famous DonQuixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.”“Say on,” said I, listening to his talk; “how do you propose to make upfor my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I amin?”To which he made answer, “Your first difficulty about the sonnets,epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, andwhich ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed ifyou yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwardsbaptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them onPrester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to myknowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they werenot, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question thefact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lieagainst you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.“As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom youtake the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is onlycontriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you mayhappen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you muchtrouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, toinsert_Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;_and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if youallude to the power of death, to come in with—_Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,Regumque turres._“If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go atonce to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amountof research, and quote no less than the words of God himself: _Egoautem dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros._ If you speak of evilthoughts, turn to the Gospel: _De corde exeunt cogitationes malæ._ Ifof the fickleness of friends, there is Cato, who will give you hisdistich:_Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris._“With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for agrammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour andprofit.“With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you maysafely do it in this way. If you mention any giant in your bookcontrive that it shall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, whichwill cost you almost nothing, you have a grand note, for you canput—_The giant Golias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherdDavid slew by a mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as isrelated in the Book of Kings_—in the chapter where you find it written.“Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature andcosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story,and there you are at once with another famous annotation, settingforth—_The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has itssource in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing thewalls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that ithas golden sands_, etc. If you should have anything to do with robbers,I will give you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if withloose women, there is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you theloan of Lamia, Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring yougreat credit; if with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you withMedea; if with witches or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and VirgilCirce; if with valiant captains, Julius Cæsar himself will lend youhimself in his own ‘Commentaries,’ and Plutarch will give you athousand Alexanders. If you should deal with love, with two ounces youmay know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who will supply youto your heart’s content; or if you should not care to go to foreigncountries you have at home Fonseca’s ‘Of the Love of God,’ in which iscondensed all that you or the most imaginative mind can want on thesubject. In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote thesenames, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to meto insert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that’sgood to fill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of thebook.“Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You haveonly to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as yousay yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, andthough the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so littleneed to borrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably besome simple enough to believe that you have made use of them all inthis plain, artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no otherpurpose, this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprisinglook of authority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself toverify whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being noway concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book ofyours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for itis, from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, ofwhich Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero hadany knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations ofastrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor havegeometrical measurements or refutations of the arguments used inrhetoric anything to do with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody,mixing up things human and divine, a sort of motley in which noChristian understanding should dress itself. It has only to availitself of truth to nature in its composition, and the more perfect theimitation the better the work will be. And as this piece of yours aimsat nothing more than to destroy the authority and influence which booksof chivalry have in the world and with the public, there is no need foryou to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, precepts from HolyScripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miracles fromsaints; but merely to take care that your style and diction runmusically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placedwords, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, andputting your ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity.Strive, too, that in reading your story the melancholy may be moved tolaughter, and the merry made merrier still; that the simple shall notbe wearied, that the judicious shall admire the invention, that thegrave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to praise it. Finally,keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that ill-founded edifice ofthe books of chivalry, hated by some and praised by many more; for ifyou succeed in this you will have achieved no small success.”In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and hisobservations made such an impression on me that, without attempting toquestion them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determinedto make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive myfriend’s good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in sucha time of need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, withoutaddition or alteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of LaMancha, who is held by all the inhabitants of the district of the Campode Montiel to have been the chastest lover and the bravest knight thathas for many years been seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire tomagnify the service I render thee in making thee acquainted with sorenowned and honoured a knight, but I do desire thy thanks for theacquaintance thou wilt make with the famous Sancho Panza, his squire,in whom, to my thinking, I have given thee condensed all the squirelydrolleries that are scattered through the swarm of the vain books ofchivalry. And so—may God give thee health, and not forget me. Vale.SOME COMMENDATORY VERSESURGANDA THE UNKNOWNTo the book of Don Quixote of la ManchaIf to be welcomed by the good,    O Book! thou make thy steady aim,No empty chatterer will dare    To question or dispute thy claim.But if perchance thou hast a mind    To win of idiots approbation,Lost labour will be thy reward,    Though they’ll pretend appreciation.They say a goodly shade he finds    Who shelters ’neath a goodly tree;And such a one thy kindly star    In Bejar bath provided thee:A royal tree whose spreading boughs    A show of princely fruit display;A tree that bears a noble Duke,    The Alexander of his day.Of a Manchegan gentleman    Thy purpose is to tell the story,Relating how he lost his wits    O’er idle tales of love and glory,Of “ladies, arms, and cavaliers:”    A new Orlando Furioso—Innamorato, rather—who    Won Dulcinea del Toboso.Put no vain emblems on thy shield;    All figures—that is bragging play.A modest dedication make,    And give no scoffer room to say,“What! Álvaro de Luna here?    Or is it Hannibal again?Or does King Francis at Madrid    Once more of destiny complain?”Since Heaven it hath not pleased on thee    Deep erudition to bestow,Or black Latino’s gift of tongues,    No Latin let thy pages show.Ape not philosophy or wit,    Lest one who cannot comprehend,Make a wry face at thee and ask,    “Why offer flowers to me, my friend?”Be not a meddler; no affair    Of thine the life thy neighbours lead:Be prudent; oft the random jest    Recoils upon the jester’s head.Thy constant labour let it be    To earn thyself an honest name,For fooleries preserved in print    Are perpetuity of shame.A further counsel bear in mind:    If that thy roof be made of glass,It shows small wit to pick up stones    To pelt the people as they pass.Win the attention of the wise,    And give the thinker food for thought;Whoso indites frivolities,    Will but by simpletons be sought.AMADIS OF GAULTo Don Quixote of la ManchaSONNETThou that didst imitate that life of mine    When I in lonely sadness on the great    Rock Peña Pobre sat disconsolate,In self-imposed penance there to pine;Thou, whose sole beverage was the bitter brine    Of thine own tears, and who withouten plate    Of silver, copper, tin, in lowly stateOff the bare earth and on earth’s fruits didst dine;Live thou, of thine eternal glory sure.    So long as on the round of the fourth sphere    The bright Apollo shall his coursers steer,In thy renown thou shalt remain secure,Thy country’s name in story shall endure,    And thy sage author stand without a peer.DON BELIANIS OF GREECETo Don Quixote of la ManchaSONNETIn slashing, hewing, cleaving, word and deed,    I was the foremost knight of chivalry,    Stout, bold, expert, as e’er the world did see;Thousands from the oppressor’s wrong I freed;Great were my feats, eternal fame their meed;    In love I proved my truth and loyalty;    The hugest giant was a dwarf for me;Ever to knighthood’s laws gave I good heed.My mastery the Fickle Goddess owned,    And even Chance, submitting to control,        Grasped by the forelock, yielded to my will.Yet—though above yon horned moon enthroned        My fortune seems to sit—great Quixote, still    Envy of thy achievements fills my soul.THE LADY OF ORIANATo Dulcinea del TobosoSONNETOh, fairest Dulcinea, could it be!    It were a pleasant fancy to suppose so—    Could Miraflores change to El Toboso,And London’s town to that which shelters thee!Oh, could mine but acquire that livery    Of countless charms thy mind and body show so!    Or him, now famous grown—thou mad’st him grow so—Thy knight, in some dread combat could I see!Oh, could I be released from Amadis    By exercise of such coy chastityAs led thee gentle Quixote to dismiss!        Then would my heavy sorrow turn to joy;    None would I envy, all would envy me,        And happiness be mine without alloy.GANDALIN, SQUIRE OF AMADIS OF GAUL,To Sancho Panza, squire of Don QuixoteSONNETAll hail, illustrious man! Fortune, when she    Bound thee apprentice to the esquire trade,    Her care and tenderness of thee displayed,Shaping thy course from misadventure free.No longer now doth proud knight-errantry    Regard with scorn the sickle and the spade;    Of towering arrogance less count is madeThan of plain esquire-like simplicity.I envy thee thy Dapple, and thy name,    And those alforjas thou wast wont to stuffWith comforts that thy providence proclaim.        Excellent Sancho! hail to thee again!        To thee alone the Ovid of our Spain    Does homage with the rustic kiss and cuff.FROM EL DONOSO, THE MOTLEY POET,On Sancho Panza and RocinanteON SANCHOI am the esquire Sancho Pan—Who served Don Quixote of La Man—;But from his service I retreat—,Resolved to pass my life discreet—;For Villadiego, called the Si—,Maintained that only in reti—Was found the secret of well-be—,According to the “Celesti—:”A book divine, except for sin—By speech too plain, in my opin—ON ROCINANTEI am that Rocinante fa—,Great-grandson of great Babie—,Who, all for being lean and bon—,Had one Don Quixote for an own—;But if I matched him well in weak—,I never took short commons meek—,But kept myself in corn by steal—,A trick I learned from Lazaril—,When with a piece of straw so neat—The blind man of his wine he cheat—.ORLANDO FURIOSOTo Don Quixote of La ManchaSONNETIf thou art not a Peer, peer thou hast none;    Among a thousand Peers thou art a peer;    Nor is there room for one when thou art near,Unvanquished victor, great unconquered one!Orlando, by Angelica undone,    Am I; o’er distant seas condemned to steer,    And to Fame’s altars as an offering bearValour respected by Oblivion.I cannot be thy rival, for thy fame    And prowess rise above all rivalry,        Albeit both bereft of wits we go.But, though the Scythian or the Moor to tame    Was not thy lot, still thou dost rival me:        Love binds us in a fellowship of woe.THE KNIGHT OF PHŒBUSTo Don Quixote of La ManchaMy sword was not to be compared with thine    Phœbus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine    That smote from east to west as lightnings fly.

It is my earnest hopethat Your Excellency’s good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose,will not disdain the littleness of so humble a service.Miguel de Cervantese00.jpg (24K)CHAPTER I.WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DONQUIXOTE OF LA MANCHAp007.jpg (150K)Full SizeIn a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to callto mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep alance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhoundfor coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on mostnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or soextra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The restof it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes tomatch for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in hisbest homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a nieceunder twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used tosaddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of thisgentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit,spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. Theywill have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is somedifference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject),although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was calledQuexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; itwill be enough not to stray a hair’s breadth from the truth in thetelling of it.You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was atleisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up toreading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almostentirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even themanagement of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness andinfatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books ofchivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. Butof all there were none he liked so well as those of the famousFeliciano de Silva’s composition, for their lucidity of style andcomplicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when inhis reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often foundpassages like “_the reason of the unreason with which my reason isafflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at yourbeauty;” or again, “the high heavens, that of your divinity divinelyfortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert yourgreatness deserves_.” Over conceits of this sort the poor gentlemanlost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them andworm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not havemade out or extracted had he come to life again for that specialpurpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianisgave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were thesurgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body coveredall over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author’s wayof ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, andmany a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly asis there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made asuccessful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbingthoughts prevented him.Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learnedman, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the betterknight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, thevillage barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up tothe Knight of Phœbus, and that if there was any that could compare with_him_ it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he hada spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight,nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he wasnot a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his booksthat he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawnto dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much readinghis brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full ofwhat he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels,battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts ofimpossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabricof invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history inthe world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was avery good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight ofthe Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce andmonstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because atRoncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himselfof the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antæus the son of Terrain his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because,although of the giant breed which is always arrogant andill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all headmired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallyingforth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond theseas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, wasentirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of aGanelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into thebargain.In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notionthat ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fanciedit was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honouras for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errantof himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback inquest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he hadread of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting everykind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, inthe issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor mansaw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond atleast; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in thesepleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme intoexecution.The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged tohis great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in acorner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polishedit as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that ithad no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency,however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmetof pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one.It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand acut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first ofwhich undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The easewith which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, andto guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of ironon the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, notcaring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted itas a helmet of the most perfect construction.He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than areal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that “_tantum pelliset ossa fuit_,” surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander orthe Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name togive him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horsebelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it soas to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his mastertaking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it shouldbe a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order andcalling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struckout, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out ofhis memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, tohis thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as ahack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of allthe hacks in the world.Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious toget one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over thispoint, till at last he made up his mind to call himself “Don Quixote,”whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious historyhave inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, andnot Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that thevaliant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis andnothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make itfamous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight,resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote ofLa Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his originand country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet,his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to theconclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a ladyto be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a treewithout leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said tohimself, “If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across somegiant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, andoverthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or,in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someoneI may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on hisknees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, ‘Iam the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knightDon Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself beforeyour Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure’?” Oh,how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especiallywhen he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so thestory goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girlwith whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name wasAldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title ofLady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should notbe out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that ofa princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea delToboso—she being of El Toboso—a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himselfand the things belonging to him.p007b.jpg (61K)CHAPTER II.WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROMHOMEp007c.jpg (97K)Full SizeThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer theexecution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the worldwas losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, andduties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention toanyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawningof the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) hedonned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmeton, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of theyard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment andsatisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with hisgrand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain,when a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make himabandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that hehad not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalryhe neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and thateven if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear whitearmour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he hadearned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but hiscraze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to havehimself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following theexample of others in the same case, as he had read in the books thatbrought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on thefirst opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; andso comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horsechose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking tohimself and saying, “Who knows but that in time to come, when theveracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writesit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, willdo it after this fashion? ‘Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o’erthe face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his brighthair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned theirnotes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of therosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, wasappearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Mancheganhorizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quittingthe lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began totraverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;’” which in fact hewas actually traversing. “Happy the age, happy the time,” he continued,“in which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded inbrass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever.And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall tobe the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee,my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings.”Presently he broke out again, as if he were love-stricken in earnest,“O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hastthou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracybanish me from the presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold inremembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for loveof thee.”So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all inthe style of those his books had taught him, imitating their languageas well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sunmounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt hisbrains if he had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anythingremarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he wasanxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to try the might of hisstrong arm.p008.jpg (289K)Full SizeWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that ofPuerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I haveascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annalsof La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfallhis hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, lookingall around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd’s shantywhere he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceivednot far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guidinghim to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; andquickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At thedoor were standing two young women, girls of the district as they callthem, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced tohalt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to ouradventurer, everything he saw or imagined seemed to him to be and tohappen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he saw the innhe pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets andpinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat andall the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To thisinn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distancefrom it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himselfupon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knightwas approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it,and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for theinn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there,and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies takingtheir ease at the castle gate.At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going throughthe stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, thatis what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring themtogether, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he wasexpecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so withprodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who,seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance andbuckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote,guessing their fear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor,disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentlevoice addressed them, “Your ladyships need not fly or fear anyrudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which Iprofess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as yourappearance proclaims you to be.” The girls were looking at him andstraining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visorobscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing somuch out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, whichmade Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, “Modesty becomes the fair, andmoreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this,however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none otherthan to serve you.”The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalieronly increased the ladies’ laughter, and that increased his irritation,and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord hadnot come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any morethan his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at allindisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement;but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, hethought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, “Señor Caballero, ifyour worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in theinn) there is plenty of everything else here.” Don Quixote, observingthe respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeperand inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, “Sir Castellan, for meanything will suffice, for‘My armour is my only wear,My only rest the fray.’”The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a“worthy of Castile,” though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one fromthe strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full oftricks as a student or a page. “In that case,” said he,“‘Your bed is on the flinty rock,Your sleep to watch alway;’and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity ofsleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for asingle night.” So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for DonQuixote, who got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he hadnot broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take greatcare of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate breadin this world. The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as goodas Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in thestable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom thedamsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were nowrelieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate andbackpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget orremove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with greenribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut.This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained allthe evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that canbe imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking thebaggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to thecastle, he said to them with great sprightliness:“Oh, never, surely, was there knightSo served by hand of dame,As served was he, Don Quixote hight,When from his town he came;With maidens waiting on himself,Princesses on his hack——or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse’s name, and DonQuixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention ofdeclaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour hadmade me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot tothe present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogetherprematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to commandand me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire toserve you.”The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, hadnothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything toeat. “I would gladly eat a bit of something,” said Don Quixote, “for Ifeel it would come very seasonably.” The day happened to be a Friday,and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish theycall in Castile “abadejo,” in Andalusia “bacallao,” and in some places“curadillo,” and in others “troutlet;” so they asked him if he thoughthe could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. “Ifthere be troutlets enough,” said Don Quixote, “they will be the samething as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eightreals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be thatthese troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, whichis better than goat. But whatever it be let it come quickly, for theburden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to theinside.” They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sakeof the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worsecooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his ownarmour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having hishelmet on and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands putanything into his mouth unless someone else placed it there, and thisservice one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything todrink was impossible, or would have been so had not the landlord boreda reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into himthrough the other; all which he bore with patience rather than severthe ribbons of his helmet.While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, ashe approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and therebycompletely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, andthat they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish wastrout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord thecastellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterpriseand sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him tothink he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he couldnot lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order ofknighthood.e02.jpg (39K)CHAPTER III.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELFDUBBED A KNIGHTp009.jpg (164K)Full SizeHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothousesupper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shuttinghimself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying,“From this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grantsme the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and thebenefit of the human race.” The landlord, seeing his guest at his feetand hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him inbewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him torise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boondemanded of him. “I looked for no less, my lord, from your HighMagnificence,” replied Don Quixote, “and I have to tell you that theboon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dubme knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms inthe chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will beaccomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roamthrough all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalfof those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errantlike myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.”The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, andhad already some suspicion of his guest’s want of wits, was quiteconvinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to makesport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So hetold him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, andthat such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers asdistinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be;and that he himself in his younger days had followed the samehonourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts ofthe world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles ofRiaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, theOlivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar,the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters,where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of hisfingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids andswindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice ofalmost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last hehad retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon hisproperty and upon that of others; and where he received allknights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for thegreat love he bore them and that they might share their substance withhim in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in thiscastle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour,as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a caseof necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watchit that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, Godwilling, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have himdubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so.He asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote repliedthat he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant hehad never read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlordtold him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories,because in the author’s opinion there was no need to mention anythingso obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to besupposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard itas certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom therewere so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnishedpurses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a littlebox of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plainsand deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it wasnot always that there was someone to cure them, unless indeed they hadfor a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetchingthrough the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of waterof such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of theirhurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had notreceived any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, theknights of old took care to see that their squires were provided withmoney and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healingpurposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which wasrarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything incunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse’s croup, as ifit were something else of more importance, because, unless for somesuch reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regardedamong knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson sosoon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth totravel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find theadvantage of them when he least expected it.Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it wasarranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard atone side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placedit on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing hisbuckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air tomarch up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his marchnight began to fall.The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze ofhis guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony hecontemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, theyflocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure hesometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazedon his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and asthe night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that itmight vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did wasplainly seen by all.Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to waterhis team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote’s armour as it layon the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loudvoice, “O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay handson the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, havea care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thylife as the penalty of thy rashness.” The carrier gave no heed to thesewords (and he would have done better to heed them if he had beenheedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armoursome distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes toheaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea,exclaimed, “Aid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter thatpresents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; letnot thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;” and,with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his bucklerhe lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow onthe carrier’s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned thathad he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of asurgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned tohis beat with the same serenity as before.p010.jpg (261K)Full SizeShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for thecarrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving waterto his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clearthe trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aidfrom anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted hislance, and without actually breaking the second carrier’s head intopieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At thenoise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them thelandlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, andwith his hand on his sword exclaimed, “O Lady of Beauty, strength andsupport of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thygreatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty anadventure.” By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not haveflinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. Thecomrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from adistance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as besthe could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave hisarmour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone,for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he wouldnot be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted DonQuixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle,who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain anda low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, hewould call to account for his treachery. “But of you,” he cried, “baseand vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all yecan against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly andinsolence will be.” This he uttered with so much spirit and boldnessthat he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much forthis reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoninghim, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the samecalmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of thelandlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him atonce the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventurecould occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people,who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he hadalready told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor wasit needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood theceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight layin the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could beadministered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done allthat was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements weresatisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more thanfour about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood thereready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch aspossible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbedknight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle,except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book inwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to thecarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damselsalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade himkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeatingsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his handand gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, asmart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teethas if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one ofthe ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with greatself-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent aburst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they hadalready seen of the novice knight’s prowess kept their laughter withinbounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, “MayGod make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success inbattle.” Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from thattime forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he hadreceived, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour heacquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility thatshe was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler ofToledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever shemight be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote saidin reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumedthe “Don” and called herself Doña Tolosa. She promised she would, andthen the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost thesame conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, andshe said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of arespectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixoterequested that she would adopt the “Don” and call herself DoñaMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion thesenever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he sawhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; andsaddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as hereturned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him inlanguage so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of itor report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with noless rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon himto pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.p017.jpg (54K)Full SizeCHAPTER IV.OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INNp018.jpg (94K)Full SizeDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, soexhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy waslike to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of hishost as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially thatreferring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and providehimself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securinga farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but verywell qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this objecthe turned his horse’s head towards his village, and Rocinante, thusreminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardlyseemed to tread the earth.He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed tocome feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heardthem he exclaimed, “Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation Ihave undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries,no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing myaid and protection;” and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the directionwhence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces intothe wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, andstripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lustyfarmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow withscoldings and commands, repeating, “Your mouth shut and your eyesopen!” while the youth made answer, “I won’t do it again, master mine;by God’s passion I won’t do it again, and I’ll take more care of theflock another time.”Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,“Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannotdefend himself; mount your steed and take your lance” (for there was alance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), “and I willmake you know that you are behaving as a coward.” The farmer, seeingbefore him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over hishead, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, “Sir Knight,this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watcha flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I loseone every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knaveryhe says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages Iowe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies.”“Lies before me, base clown!” said Don Quixote. “By the sun that shineson us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at oncewithout another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make anend of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.”p019.jpg (339K)Full SizeThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, ofwhom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added itup, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to payit down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he hadsworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there wereto be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had givenhim, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.“All that is very well,” said Don Quixote; “but let the shoes and theblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given himwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paidfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took bloodfrom him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so onthat score he owes you nothing.”“The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andrescome home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.”“I go with him!” said the youth. “Nay, God forbid! No, señor, not forthe world; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a SaintBartholomew.”“He will do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “I have only tocommand, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order ofknighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee thepayment.”“Consider what you are saying, señor,” said the youth; “this master ofmine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; forhe is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.”“That matters little,” replied Don Quixote; “there may be Haldudosknights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.”“That is true,” said Andres; “but this master of mine—of what works ishe the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?”“I do not refuse, brother Andres,” said the farmer, “be good enough tocome along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood thereare in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, andperfumed.”“For the perfumery I excuse you,” said Don Quixote; “give it to him inreals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out andpunish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than alizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you,that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorousDon Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so,God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and swornunder those penalties that have been already declared to you.”So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. Thefarmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had clearedthe wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, andsaid, “Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as thatundoer of wrongs has commanded me.”“My oath on it,” said Andres, “your worship will be well advised toobey the command of that good knight—may he live a thousand years—for,as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, hewill come back and do as he said.”“My oath on it, too,” said the farmer; “but as I have a strongaffection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to thepayment;” and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gavehim such a flogging that he left him for dead.“Now, Master Andres,” said the farmer, “call on the undoer of wrongs;you will find he won’t undo that, though I am not sure that I havequite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.” But atlast he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge inorder to put the sentence pronounced into execution.Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to lookfor the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what hadhappened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but forall that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughlysatisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made avery happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the roadtowards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice,“Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, ODulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thylot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure aknight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, asall the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, andhath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that everinjustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day pluckedthe rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashingthat tender child.”He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately hewas reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop toconsider which road they should take. In imitation of them he haltedfor a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinantehis head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed outhis first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable.After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large partyof people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, ontheir way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming alongunder their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteerson foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancypossessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him toimitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books,here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt.So with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly inhis stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before hisbreast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waitingthe approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered andheld them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, heexclaimed with a haughty gesture, “All the world stand, unless all theworld confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than theEmpress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.”The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of thestrange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language atonce guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learnquietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded ofthem, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was verysharp-witted, said to him, “Sir Knight, we do not know who this goodlady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of suchbeauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure wewill confess the truth that is on your part required of us.”“If I were to show her to you,” replied Don Quixote, “what merit wouldyou have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is thatwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defendit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogantrabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order ofknighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage ofyour breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of thecause I maintain.”“Sir Knight,” replied the trader, “I entreat your worship in the nameof this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging ourconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heardof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses andQueens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased toshow us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grainof wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way weshall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay,I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though herportrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion andsulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship,say all in her favour that you desire.”“She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,” said Don Quixote,burning with rage, “nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris andcivet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter thana Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have utteredagainst beauty like that of my lady.”And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who hadspoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrivedthat Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gonehard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went hismaster, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he triedto rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs,helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he wasstruggling to get up he kept saying, “Fly not, cowards and caitiffs!stay, for not by my fault, but my horse’s, am I stretched here.”p020.jpg (352K)Full SizeOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much goodnature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and comingup to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with oneof them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstandingand in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. Hismasters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, butthe muleteer’s blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game untilhe had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remainingfragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappyvictim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him neverceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such theyseemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traderscontinued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about thepoor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone madeanother effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, howwas he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked topieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him thatthis was a regular knight-errant’s mishap, and entirely, he considered,the fault of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to risewas beyond his power.e04.jpg (28K)CHAPTER V.IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT’S MISHAP IS CONTINUEDp022.jpg (123K)Full SizeFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself ofhaving recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passagein his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin andthe Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on themountainside, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten bythe young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and forall that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed tohim to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making ashow of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and withfeeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of thewood is said to have uttered:Where art thou, lady mine, that thouMy sorrow dost not rue?Thou canst not know it, lady mine,Or else thou art untrue.And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:O noble Marquis of Mantua,My Uncle and liege lord!p026.jpg (316K)Full SizeAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened tocome by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who hadbeen with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretchedthere, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matterwith him that he complained so dolefully.Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua,his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, inwhich he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of theEmperor’s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him ofthe visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face,which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so herecognised him and said, “Señor Quixada” (for so he appears to havebeen called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from aquiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), “who has brought yourworship to this pass?” But to all questions the other only went on withhis ballad.Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplateand backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive noblood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from theground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, whichseemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms,even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, andleading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the roadfor the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote wastalking.p029.jpg (285K)Full SizeNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he couldnot sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs toheaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him.And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his headtales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, hebethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide ofAntequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him awayto his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was andwhat ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases thatthe captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had readthe story in the “Diana” of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written,applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went alongcursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; fromwhich, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad,and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomenessof this harangue of Don Quixote’s; who, at the end of it, said, “SeñorDon Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa Ihave mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I havedone, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that inthis world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.”To this the peasant answered, “Señor—sinner that I am!—cannot yourworship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis ofMantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship isneither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman SeñorQuixada?”“I know who I am,” replied Don Quixote, “and I know that I may be notonly those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and evenall the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they havedone all together and each of them on his own account.”With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village justas night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was alittle later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding insuch a miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper timehe entered the village and went to Don Quixote’s house, which he foundall in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, whowere great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying tothem in a loud voice, “What does your worship think can have befallenmy master, Señor Licentiate Pero Perez?” for so the curate was called;“it is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack,or the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, andit is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books ofchivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,have upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him sayingto himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the worldin quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, thathave brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was inall La Mancha!”The niece said the same, and, more: “You must know, MasterNicholas”—for that was the name of the barber—“it was often my uncle’sway to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy booksof misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch uphis sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out hewould say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweatthat flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of thewounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jugof cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was amost precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician andfriend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myselffor never having told your worships of my uncle’s vagaries, that youmight put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burnall these accursed books—for he has a great number—that richly deserveto be burned like heretics.”“So say I too,” said the curate, “and by my faith to-morrow shall notpass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned tothe flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friendseems to have behaved.”All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what wasthe matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, “Open, yourworships, to Señor Baldwin and to Señor the Marquis of Mantua, whocomes badly wounded, and to Señor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom thevaliant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.”At these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised theirfriend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the assbecause he could not, they ran to embrace him.“Hold!” said he, “for I am badly wounded through my horse’s fault;carry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure andsee to my wounds.”“See there! plague on it!” cried the housekeeper at this: “did not myheart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bedwith your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you herewithout fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundredtimes more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worshipto such a pass.”They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his woundscould find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had asevere fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants,the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.“So, so!” said the curate, “are there giants in the dance? By the signof the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.”They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to allwas—give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that waswhat he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasantat great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, andthe nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all whichmade the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day,which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go withhim to Don Quixote’s house.p031.jpg (31K)CHAPTER VI.OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBERMADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMANc06a.jpg (92K)Full SizeHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys ofthe room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, andright willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper withthem, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very wellbound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw themshe turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediatelywith a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, “Here, yourworship, señor licentiate, sprinkle this room; don’t leave any magicianof the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for ourdesign of banishing them from the world.”The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and hedirected the barber to give him the books one by one to see what theywere about, as there might be some to be found among them that did notdeserve the penalty of fire.“No,” said the niece, “there is no reason for showing mercy to any ofthem; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them outof the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire tothem; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be madewithout the smoke giving any annoyance.” The housekeeper said the same,so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but thecurate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate thetitles.The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was “The four books ofAmadis of Gaul.” “This seems a mysterious thing,” said the curate,“for, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printedin Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin;so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flamesas the founder of so vile a sect.”“Nay, sir,” said the barber, “I too, have heard say that this is thebest of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, assomething singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.”“True,” said the curate; “and for that reason let its life be sparedfor the present. Let us see that other which is next to it.”“It is,” said the barber, “the ‘Sergas de Esplandian,’ the lawful sonof Amadis of Gaul.”“Then verily,” said the curate, “the merit of the father must not beput down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; openthe window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of thepile for the bonfire we are to make.”The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy“Esplandian” went flying into the yard to await with all patience thefire that was in store for him.“Proceed,” said the curate.“This that comes next,” said the barber, “is ‘Amadis of Greece,’ and,indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadislineage.”“Then to the yard with the whole of them,” said the curate; “for tohave the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel andhis eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author,I would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going aboutin the guise of a knight-errant.”“I am of the same mind,” said the barber.“And so am I,” added the niece.“In that case,” said the housekeeper, “here, into the yard with them!”They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she sparedherself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.“Who is that tub there?” said the curate.“This,” said the barber, “is ‘Don Olivante de Laura.’”“The author of that book,” said the curate, “was the same that wrote‘The Garden of Flowers,’ and truly there is no deciding which of thetwo books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying;all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.”“This that follows is ‘Florismarte of Hircania,’” said the barber.“Señor Florismarte here?” said the curate; “then by my faith he musttake up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth andvisionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his styledeserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistresshousekeeper.”“With all my heart, señor,” said she, and executed the order with greatdelight.“This,” said the barber, “is ‘The Knight Platir.’”“An old book that,” said the curate, “but I find no reason for clemencyin it; send it after the others without appeal;” which was done.Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, “The Knight ofthe Cross.”“For the sake of the holy name this book has,” said the curate, “itsignorance might be excused; but then, they say, ‘behind the crossthere’s the devil;’ to the fire with it.”Taking down another book, the barber said, “This is ‘The Mirror ofChivalry.’”“I know his worship,” said the curate; “that is where Señor Reinaldosof Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thievesthan Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historianTurpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetualbanishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the inventionof the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet LudovicoAriosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking anylanguage but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if hespeaks his own tongue I will put him upon my head.”“Well, I have him in Italian,” said the barber, “but I do notunderstand him.”“Nor would it be well that you should understand him,” said the curate,“and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had notbrought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him ofa great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turnbooks written in verse into another language, for, with all the painsthey take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach thelevel of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I saythat this book, and all that may be found treating of those Frenchaffairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, untilafter more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;excepting always one ‘Bernardo del Carpio’ that is going about, andanother called ‘Roncesvalles;’ for these, if they come into my hands,shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers intothe fire without any reprieve.”To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right andproper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith andloyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposedto them. Opening another book he saw it was “Palmerin de Oliva,” andbeside it was another called “Palmerin of England,” seeing which thelicentiate said, “Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burneduntil no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept andpreserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case bemade for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Dariusand set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. Thisbook, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is verygood, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wiseand witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle ofMiraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the languageis polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting thespeaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good toyou, Master Nicholas, I say let this and ‘Amadis of Gaul’ be remittedthe penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish withoutfurther question or query.”“Nay, gossip,” said the barber, “for this that I have here is thefamous ‘Don Belianis.’”“Well,” said the curate, “that and the second, third, and fourth partsall stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile,and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame andother greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed theover-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justicebe meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them inyour house and let no one read them.”“With all my heart,” said the barber; and not caring to tire himselfwith reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to takeall the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to onedull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving thebroadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at atime, she flung them out of the window.In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of thebarber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found itsaid, “History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.”“God bless me!” said the curate with a shout, “‘Tirante el Blanco’here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasuryof enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison ofMontalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, andthe knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with themastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the lovesand wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with thesquire Hipolito—in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the bestbook in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds,and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which thereis nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it,for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to thegalleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will seethat what I have said is true.”“As you will,” said the barber; “but what are we to do with theselittle books that are left?”“These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,” said the curate; and openingone he saw it was the “Diana” of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposingall the others to be of the same sort, “these,” he said, “do notdeserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can dothe mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books ofentertainment that can hurt no one.”“Ah, señor!” said the niece, “your worship had better order these to beburned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after beingcured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took afancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing andpiping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say isan incurable and infectious malady.”“The damsel is right,” said the curate, “and it will be well to putthis stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend’s way. To begin,then, with the ‘Diana’ of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not beburned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sageFelicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces ofverse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being thefirst of books of the kind.”“This that comes next,” said the barber, “is the ‘Diana,’ entitled the‘Second Part, by the Salamancan,’ and this other has the same title,and its author is Gil Polo.”“As for that of the Salamancan,” replied the curate, “let it go toswell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo’s bepreserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, andmake haste, for it is growing late.”“This book,” said the barber, opening another, “is the ten books of the‘Fortune of Love,’ written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.”“By the orders I have received,” said the curate, “since Apollo hasbeen Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets,so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in itsway it is the best and the most singular of all of this species thathave as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he hasnever read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make moreaccount of having found it than if they had given me a cassock ofFlorence stuff.”He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on,“These that come next are ‘The Shepherd of Iberia,’ ‘Nymphs ofHenares,’ and ‘The Enlightenment of Jealousy.’”“Then all we have to do,” said the curate, “is to hand them over to thesecular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall neverhave done.”“This next is the ‘Pastor de Fílida.’”“No Pastor that,” said the curate, “but a highly polished courtier; letit be preserved as a precious jewel.”“This large one here,” said the barber, “is called ‘The Treasury ofvarious Poems.’”“If there were not so many of them,” said the curate, “they would bemore relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certainvulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preservedbecause the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for othermore heroic and loftier works that he has written.”“This,” continued the barber, “is the ‘Cancionero’ of Lopez deMaldonado.”“The author of that book, too,” said the curate, “is a great friend ofmine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all whohear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants whenhe chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what isgood was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have beenset apart. But what book is that next it?”“The ‘Galatea’ of Miguel de Cervantes,” said the barber.“That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and tomy knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. Hisbook has some good invention in it, it presents us with something butbrings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part itpromises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the fullmeasure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,señor gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.”“Very good,” said the barber; “and here come three together, the‘Araucana’ of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the ‘Austriada’ of Juan Rufo,Justice of Cordova, and the ‘Montserrate’ of Christobal de Virués, theValencian poet.”“These three books,” said the curate, “are the best that have beenwritten in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with themost famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures ofpoetry that Spain possesses.”The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so hedecided that, “contents uncertified,” all the rest should be burned;but just then the barber held open one, called “The Tears of Angelica.”“I should have shed tears myself,” said the curate when he heard thetitle, “had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one ofthe famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happyin the translation of some of Ovid’s fables.”c06e.jpg (30K)CHAPTER VII.OF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHAc07a.jpg (151K)Full SizeAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, “Here, here, valiantknights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strongarms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!”Called away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther withthe scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that “TheCarolea,” “The Lion of Spain,” and “The Deeds of the Emperor,” writtenby Don Luis de Ávila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubtthey were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seenthem they would not have undergone so severe a sentence.When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was stillshouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awakeas if he had never slept.They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he hadbecome a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, “Of atruth, Señor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who callourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of theCourt to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers havingcarried off the honour on the three former days.”“Hush, gossip,” said the curate; “please God, the luck may turn, andwhat is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let yourworship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you areover-fatigued, if not badly wounded.”“Wounded no,” said Don Quixote, “but bruised and battered no doubt, forthat bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in hisachievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan didhe not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I risefrom this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, forthat, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me toavenge myself.”They did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more hefell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were inthe yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed thatdeserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and thelaziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verifiedthe proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately appliedto their friend’s disorder was to wall up and plaster the room wherethe books were, so that when he got up he should not find them(possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and theymight say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and thiswas done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and thefirst thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding theroom where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking forit. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it withhis hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction withoutsaying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeperwhereabouts was the room that held his books.The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she wasto answer, said, “What room or what nothing is it that your worship islooking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, forthe devil himself has carried all away.”“It was not the devil,” said the niece, “but a magician who came on acloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismountingfrom a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did thereI know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through theroof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what hehad done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, thehousekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loudvoice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and theroom, he had done mischief in that house that would be discoveredby-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Muñaton.”“He must have said Friston,” said Don Quixote.“I don’t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,” said thehousekeeper, “I only know that his name ended with ‘ton.’”“So it does,” said Don Quixote, “and he is a sage magician, a greatenemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his artsand lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with aknight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will beunable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me allthe ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him tooppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.”“Who doubts that?” said the niece; “but, uncle, who mixes you up inthese quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your ownhouse instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than evercame of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come backshorn?”“Oh, niece of mine,” replied Don Quixote, “how much astray art thou inthy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and strippedoff the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair ofmine.”The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that hisanger was kindling.In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly withoutshowing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, andduring this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, thecurate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errantwere what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to beaccomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimescontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observedthis precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his,an honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor),but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over,and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up hismind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote,among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with himgladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win anisland in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. Onthese and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer wascalled) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to hisneighbour.c07b.jpg (322K)Full SizeDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thingand pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he gottogether a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which hebegged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet asbest he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meantto set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought mostneedful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The othersaid he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had,as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixotehesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind anyknight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but noinstance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determinedto take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount whena chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of thefirst discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided withshirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice thehost had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, SanchoPanza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper andniece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night,and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they heldthemselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota,and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master hadpromised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and roadhe had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel,which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for,as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely,the heat did not distress them.And now said Sancho Panza to his master, “Your worship will take care,Señor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promisedme, for be it ever so big I’ll be equal to governing it.”To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza,that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant ofold to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms theywon, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part inso liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, forthey sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squireswere old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard daysand worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or atthe most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thoulivest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I mayhave won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will bejust the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Norneedst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to thelot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I mighteasily give thee even more than I promise thee.”“In that case,” said Sancho Panza, “if I should become a king by one ofthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my oldwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.”“Well, who doubts it?” said Don Quixote.“I doubt it,” replied Sancho Panza, “because for my part I am persuadedthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of themwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, señor, she isnot worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, andthat only with God’s help.”“Leave it to God, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “for he will give herwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to cometo be content with anything less than being governor of a province.”“I will not, señor,” answered Sancho, “specially as I have a man ofsuch quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give meall that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.”c07e.jpg (70K)CHAPTER VIII.OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLEAND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCESWORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDEDc08a.jpg (142K)Full SizeAt this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills thatthere are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said tohis squire, “Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we couldhave shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza,where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom Imean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall beginto make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God’sgood service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.”“What giants?” said Sancho Panza.“Those thou seest there,” answered his master, “with the long arms, andsome have them nearly two leagues long.”“Look, your worship,” said Sancho; “what we see there are not giantsbut windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turnedby the wind make the millstone go.”“It is easy to see,” replied Don Quixote, “that thou art not used tothis business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid,away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engagethem in fierce and unequal combat.”So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of thecries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainlythey were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however,was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries ofSancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at themshouting, “Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knightattacks you.”A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began tomove, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, “Though ye flourish more armsthan the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.”So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his ladyDulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance inrest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante’s fullestgallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but ashe drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round withsuch force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horseand rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition.Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and whenhe came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinantefallen with him.c08b.jpg (358K)Full Size“God bless me!” said Sancho, “did I not tell your worship to mind whatyou were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could havemade any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind inhis head.”“Hush, friend Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “the fortunes of war morethan any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover Ithink, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried offmy study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to robme of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me;but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my goodsword.”c08c.jpg (301K)Full Size“God order it as he may,” said Sancho Panza, and helping him to risegot him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures inabundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, hewas much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,he added, “I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez deVargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak aponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, andpounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he andhis descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. Imention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend suchanother branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determinedand resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself veryfortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be aneyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.”“Be that as God will,” said Sancho, “I believe it all as your worshipsays it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on oneside, may be from the shaking of the fall.”“That is the truth,” said Don Quixote, “and if I make no complaint ofthe pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain ofany wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.”“If so,” said Sancho, “I have nothing to say; but God knows I wouldrather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, Iconfess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this ruleabout not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.”Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire’s simplicity, and heassured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as heliked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary inthe order of knighthood.Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his masteranswered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that _he_ mighteat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself ascomfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjaswhat he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his mastermunching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the botawith a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied;and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught,he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him,nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in questof adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed thenight among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a drybranch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it thehead he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote layawake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he hadread in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knightsused to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Notso did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of somethingstronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if hismaster had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on hisface nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach ofday would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the botaand found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grievedhis heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy thedeficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, ashas been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections fornourishment.They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to PuertoLapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. “Here,brother Sancho Panza,” said Don Quixote when he saw it, “we may plungeour hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thoumust not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thouperceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for inthat case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights itis on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood tohelp me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.”“Most certainly, señor,” replied Sancho, “your worship shall be fullyobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and nofriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards thedefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, forlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against anyassailant whatever.”“That I grant,” said Don Quixote, “but in this matter of aiding meagainst knights thou must put a restraint upon thy naturalimpetuosity.”“I will do so, I promise you,” answered Sancho, “and will keep thisprecept as carefully as Sunday.”While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars ofthe order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not lesstall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectaclesand carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four orfive persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach therewas, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, whereher husband was about to take passage for the Indies with anappointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them hesaid to his squire, “Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be themost famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodieswe see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying offsome stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undothis wrong.”“This will be worse than the windmills,” said Sancho. “Look, señor;those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to sometravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don’t letthe devil mislead you.”“I have told thee already, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that on thesubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, asthou shalt see presently.”So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the roadalong which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they hadcome near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, “Devilish andunnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom youare carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedydeath as the just punishment of your evil deeds.”The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of DonQuixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, “SeñorCaballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there areany captive princesses coming in this coach.”“No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,” said DonQuixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and withlevelled lance charged the first friar with such fury anddetermination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sorewounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how hiscomrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and madeoff across the country faster than the wind.Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting brisklyfrom his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. Atthat instant the friars’ muleteers came up and asked what he wasstripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfullyas spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. Themuleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all thisabout battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance offtalking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked himdown, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicksand left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; andwithout any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurredafter his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for theend of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making morecrosses than if they had the devil after them.Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:“Your beauty, lady mine,” said he, “may now dispose of your person asmay be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of yourravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, knowthat I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant andadventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea delToboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask nomore than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf presentyourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set youfree.”One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, waslistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he wouldnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once toEl Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in badCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, “Begone, caballero, andill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.”Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,“If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have alreadychastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.” To which theBiscayan returned, “I no gentleman!—I swear to God thou liest as I amChristian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thousee thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo atsea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thouliest.”“‘“You will see presently,” said Agrajes,’” replied Don Quixote; andthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckleron his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismountfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out forhire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it waslucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he wasable to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went atone another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others stroveto make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared inhis disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle hewould kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. Thelady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered thecoachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severestruggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote amighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, givento one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, “Olady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of thisyour knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, findshimself in this extreme peril.” To say this, to lift his sword, toshelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan wasthe work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon asingle blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, wasconvinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved tofollow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover ofhis cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with hismule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, couldnot stir a step.On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and underthe protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waitingin suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and thelady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousandvows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that Godmight deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in whichthey found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisisthe author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving asexcuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievementsof Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true thesecond author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history socurious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not topreserve in their archives or registries some documents referring tothis famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despairof finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heavenfavouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the SecondPart.c08e.jpg (54K)CHAPTER IX.IN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THEGALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGANc09a.jpg (142K)Full SizeIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and therenowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver twosuch furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair theywould at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe andlaid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point thedelightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without anyintimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from havingread such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poorchance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so itseemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared tome to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so gooda knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task ofwriting his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting toany of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; forevery one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who notonly recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughtsand follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight couldnot have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others likehim had in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe thatsuch a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid theblame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that hadeither concealed or consumed it.On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books therehad been found such modern ones as “The Enlightenment of Jealousy” andthe “Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,” his story must likewise bemodern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in thememory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood.This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and trulythe whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixoteof La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the firstthat in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labourand exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs,succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used toride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginityabout them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valley—for, if itwere not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, ormonstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damselsthat at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slepta day under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothersthat bore them. I say, then, that in these and other respects ourgallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, norshould it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent insearching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I knowwell that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, theworld would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasurethat for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read itattentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell somepamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of readingeven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bentof mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and sawthat it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I wasunable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about tosee if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them forme; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter,for even had I sought one for an older and better language I shouldhave found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I toldhim what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in themiddle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked himwhat he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something thebook had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it tome; and he still laughing said, “In the margin, as I told you, this iswritten: ‘_This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history,had, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for saltingpigs_.’”When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise andamazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets containedthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read thebeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, hetold me it meant, “_History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by CidHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian_.” It required great caution tohide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, andsnatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers andpamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his witsabout him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safelycalculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew atonce with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and beggedhim to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into theCastilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offeringhim whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas ofraisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate themfaithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, andnot to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to myhouse, where in little more than a month and a half he translated thewhole just as it is set down here.In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayanwas drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as thehistory describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by hisbuckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan’s mule so true tonature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. TheBiscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, “_Don Sancho deAzpeitia_,” which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet ofRocinante was another that said, “_Don Quixote_.” Rocinante wasmarvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with somuch backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainlywith what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had beenbestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of hisass, at whose feet was another label that said, “Sancho Zancas,” andaccording to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body,and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza andZancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history severaltimes calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned,but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with thetrue relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as itis true.If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of itstruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a verycommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are suchenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions ratherthan additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;for, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of soworthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over insilence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the businessand duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free frompassion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should makethem swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival oftime, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counselfor the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will befound all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wantingin any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of anauthor and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part,according to the translation, began in this way:With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as thoughthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, andearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bearthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, whichwas delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned inits course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to thebitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that goodfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the swordof his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder,it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour,carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, allwhich with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorryplight.Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage thatfilled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with inthis fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raisedhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with bothhands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him fullover the cushion and over the head, that—even so good a shield provinguseless—as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed fromnose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from hismule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms aboutits neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of thestirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright atthe terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plungesflung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on verycalmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with greatbriskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to hiseyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayanwas so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it wouldhave gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladiesin the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in greatterror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnestentreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing theirsquire’s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity anddignity, “In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask ofme; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is thatthis knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on mybehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she dealwith him as shall be most pleasing to her.”The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote’sdemand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squireshould do all that had been commanded.“Then, on the faith of that promise,” said Don Quixote, “I shall do himno further harm, though he well deserves it of me.”c09e.jpg (61K)Full SizeCHAPTER X.OF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HISSQUIRE SANCHO PANZAc10a.jpg (91K)Full SizeNow by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling ofthe friars’ muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, DonQuixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will togrant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island tomake him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that thestruggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mountRocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before hecould mount, he went on his knees before him, and taking his hand,kissed it saying, “May it please your worship, Señor Don Quixote, togive me the government of that island which has been won in this hardfight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to beable to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who hasever governed islands.”To which Don Quixote replied, “Thou must take notice, brother Sancho,that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands,but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or anear the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselvesfrom which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.”Sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirtof his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his asshimself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, withouttaking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to thecoach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at hisass’s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself leftbehind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. DonQuixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up,who on reaching him said, “It seems to me, señor, it would be prudentin us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled hewith whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they giveinformation of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and,faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweatfor it.”“Peace,” said Don Quixote; “where hast thou ever seen or heard that aknight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, howevermany homicides he may have committed?”“I know nothing about omecils,” answered Sancho, “nor in my life havehad anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhoodlooks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter Ido not meddle.”“Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,” said Don Quixote,“for I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much moreout of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thouseen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thouread in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, morespirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill inoverthrowing?”“The truth is,” answered Sancho, “that I have never read any history,for I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet isthat a more daring master than your worship I have never served in allthe days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid forwhere I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound,for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here somelint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.”“All that might be well dispensed with,” said Don Quixote, “if I hadremembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time andmedicine are saved by one single drop.”“What vial and what balsam is that?” said Sancho Panza.“It is a balsam,” answered Don Quixote, “the receipt of which I have inmy memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying ofany wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothingto do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half throughthe middle of the body—as is wont to happen frequently—but neatly andwith great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of thebody which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half whichremains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly.Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I havementioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.”“If that be so,” said Panza, “I renounce henceforth the government ofthe promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many andfaithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of thissupreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two realsan ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life inease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to makeit.”“With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,” said DonQuixote.“Sinner that I am!” said Sancho, “then why does your worship put offmaking it and teaching it to me?”“Peace, friend,” answered Don Quixote; “greater secrets I mean to teachthee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present letus see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.”Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when DonQuixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose hissenses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes toheaven, he said, “I swear by the Creator of all things and the fourGospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantuadid when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and thatwas not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, andother points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grantas expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who hascommitted such an offence against me.”Hearing this, Sancho said to him, “Your worship should bear in mind,Señor Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded himin going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he willhave done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve furtherpunishment unless he commits some new offence.”“Thou hast said well and hit the point,” answered Don Quixote; and so Irecall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until suchtime as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as thisand as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with strawin doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the verysame thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino’s helmet, whichcost Sacripante so dear.”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “let your worship send all such oaths to thedevil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to theconscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall inwith no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to beobserved in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be tosleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousandother mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquisof Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let yourworship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any ofthese roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wearhelmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.”“Thou art wrong there,” said Don Quixote, “for we shall not have beenabove two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men inarmour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.”“Enough,” said Sancho; “so be it then, and God grant us success, andthat the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear maysoon come, and then let me die.”“I have already told thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “not to givethyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail,there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit theeas a ring fits the finger, and all the more that, being on _terrafirma_, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave thatto its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in thosealforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where wemay lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear tothee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.”“I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,”said Sancho, “but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight likeyour worship.”“How little thou knowest about it,” answered Don Quixote; “I would havethee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to gowithout eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it shouldbe of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to theehadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are verymany, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-erranteating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared forthem, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though itis plain they could not do without eating and performing all the othernatural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, itis plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their livesthrough woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare wouldbe rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friendSancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek tomake a new world or pervert knight-errantry.”“Pardon me, your worship,” said Sancho, “for, as I cannot read orwrite, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules ofthe profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas withevery kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and formyself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and otherthings more substantial.”“I do not say, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “that it is imperative onknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakestof; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbsthey found in the fields which they knew and I know too.”“A good thing it is,” answered Sancho, “to know those herbs, for to mythinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge intopractice.”And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made theirrepast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for thenight, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare,mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before nightset in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failedthem close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to passthe night there, and it was as much to Sancho’s discontent not to havereached a house, as it was to his master’s satisfaction to sleep underthe open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him heperformed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.c10e.jpg (57K)CHAPTER XI.WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDSc11a.jpg (173K)Full SizeHe was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as besthe could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance thatcame from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire;and though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to betransferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so asthe goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on theground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of heartygood-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins sixof the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first withrough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough whichthey placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sanchoremained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing himstanding, his master said to him:“That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry containsin itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high roadto be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thouseat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people,and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, andthat thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; forthe same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levelsall.”“Great thanks,” said Sancho, “but I may tell your worship that providedI have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and bymyself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truthis to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has muchmore relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than theturkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drinklittle, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if Iwant or do other things that are the privileges of liberty andsolitude. So, señor, as for these honours which your worship would putupon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them forother things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these,though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from thismoment to the end of the world.”“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “thou must seat thyself, because himwho humbleth himself God exalteth;” and seizing him by the arm heforced him to sit down beside himself.The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires andknights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare attheir guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing awaypieces as big as one’s fist. The course of meat finished, they spreadupon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them theyput down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. Allthis while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, nowfull, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drainedone of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote hadquite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, andcontemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in thisfashion:“Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name ofgolden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in thisour iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in itknew not the two words “_mine_” and “_thine_”! In that blessed age allthings were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required ofany save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaksthat stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. Theclear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters innoble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic inthe clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering withoutusance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. Themighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed thebroad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported byrude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Thenall was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share ofthe crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowelsof our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portionof her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delightthe children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent andfair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, withflowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to coverwhat modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornamentslike those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk torturedin endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dameswith all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity hastaught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselvessimply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commendthemselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malicehad then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held herground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and ofinterest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrarylaw had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for thenthere was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens andmodesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, withoutfear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they wereundone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hatefulage of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that ofCrete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantrywill make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal ofits accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them toruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased,the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, toprotect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this orderI belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for thehospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though bynatural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet,seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed andfeasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power Ishould thank you for yours.”c11b.jpg (349K)Full SizeAll this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) ourknight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of thegolden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessaryargument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazementwithout saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ateacorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which theyhad hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at theend of which one of the goatherds said, “That your worship, señorknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitalitywith ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by makingone of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a veryintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read andwrite and play on the rebeck to perfection.”The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeckreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a verygood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked himif he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had alreadymade the offer said to him:“In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure ofsinging a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even inthe mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thyaccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we saytrue; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thylove that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so muchliked in the town.”“With all my heart,” said the young man, and without waiting for morepressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning hisrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.ANTONIO’S BALLADThou dost love me well, Olalla;Well I know it, even thoughLove’s mute tongues, thine eyes, have neverBy their glances told me so.For I know my love thou knowest,Therefore thine to claim I dare:Once it ceases to be secret,Love need never feel despair.True it is, Olalla, sometimesThou hast all too plainly shownThat thy heart is brass in hardness,And thy snowy bosom stone.Yet for all that, in thy coyness,And thy fickle fits between,Hope is there—at least the borderOf her garment may be seen.Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,And to faith in thee I hold;Kindness cannot make it stronger,Coldness cannot make it cold.If it be that love is gentle,In thy gentleness I seeSomething holding out assuranceTo the hope of winning thee.If it be that in devotionLies a power hearts to move,That which every day I show thee,Helpful to my suit should prove.Many a time thou must have noticed—If to notice thou dost care—How I go about on MondayDressed in all my Sunday wear.Love’s eyes love to look on brightness;Love loves what is gaily drest;Sunday, Monday, all I care isThou shouldst see me in my best.No account I make of dances,Or of strains that pleased thee so,Keeping thee awake from midnightTill the cocks began to crow;Or of how I roundly swore itThat there’s none so fair as thou;True it is, but as I said it,By the girls I’m hated now.For Teresa of the hillsideAt my praise of thee was sore;Said, “You think you love an angel;It’s a monkey you adore;“Caught by all her glittering trinkets,And her borrowed braids of hair,And a host of made-up beautiesThat would Love himself ensnare.”’Twas a lie, and so I told her,And her cousin at the wordGave me his defiance for it;And what followed thou hast heard.Mine is no high-flown affection,Mine no passion _par amours_—As they call it—what I offerIs an honest love, and pure.Cunning cords the holy Church has,Cords of softest silk they be;Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;Mine will follow, thou wilt see.Else—and once for all I swear itBy the saint of most renown—If I ever quit the mountains,’Twill be in a friar’s gown.Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixoteentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being moreinclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to hismaster, “Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean topass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does notallow them to spend the night in singing.”“I understand thee, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “I perceive clearlythat those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep ratherthan in music.”“It’s sweet to us all, blessed be God,” said Sancho.“I do not deny it,” replied Don Quixote; “but settle thyself where thouwilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching thanin sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this earfor me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.”Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which itwould be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of whichthere was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with alittle salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with abandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and soit proved.c11e.jpg (37K)CHAPTER XII.OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTEc12a.jpg (143K)Full SizeJust then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisionsfrom the village, came up and said, “Do you know what is going on inthe village, comrades?”“How could we know it?” replied one of them.“Well, then, you must know,” continued the young man, “this morningthat famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumouredthat he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter ofGuillermo the Rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the dressof a shepherdess.”“You mean Marcela?” said one.“Her I mean,” answered the goatherd; “and the best of it is, he hasdirected in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor,and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, asthe story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the placewhere he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which theclergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed becausethey savour of paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio thestudent, he who, like him, also went dressed as a shepherd, repliesthat everything must be done without any omission according to thedirections left by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all incommotion; however, report says that, after all, what Ambrosio and allthe shepherds his friends desire will be done, and to-morrow they arecoming to bury him with great ceremony where I said. I am sure it willbe something worth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and see iteven if I knew I should not return to the village to-morrow.”“We will do the same,” answered the goatherds, “and cast lots to seewho must stay to mind the goats of all.”“Thou sayest well, Pedro,” said one, “though there will be no need oftaking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don’t supposeit is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter thatran into my foot the other day will not let me walk.”“For all that, we thank thee,” answered Pedro.Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who theshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the deadman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,who had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of whichhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learnedand deeply read. “Above all, they said, he was learned in the scienceof the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun andthe moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exacttime.”“Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those twoluminaries,” said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself withtrifles, went on with his story, saying, “Also he foretold when theyear was going to be one of abundance or estility.”“Sterility, you mean,” said Don Quixote.“Sterility or estility,” answered Pedro, “it is all the same in theend. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends whobelieved him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,bidding them ‘sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sowpulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and thethree following not a drop will be got.’”“That science is called astrology,” said Don Quixote.“I do not know what it is called,” replied Pedro, “but I know that heknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many monthshad passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeareddressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off thelong gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,Ambrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took tothe shepherd’s dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who isdead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he madecarols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the youngmen of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When thevillagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd’sdress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led themto make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of ourChrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property inchattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and alarge sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissoluteowner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very goodcomrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had acountenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that hehad changed his dress with no other object than to wander about thesewastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tellyou now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like itall the days of your life, though you should live more years thansarna.”“Say Sarra,” said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd’sconfusion of words.“The sarna lives long enough,” answered Pedro; “and if, señor, you mustgo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end ofit this twelvemonth.”“Pardon me, friend,” said Don Quixote; “but, as there is such adifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you haveanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continueyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.”“I say then, my dear sir,” said the goatherd, “that in our villagethere was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who wasnamed Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above greatwealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respectedwoman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now withthat countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on theother; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trustthat at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the otherworld. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good awife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of anuncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew upwith such beauty that it reminded us of her mother’s, which was verygreat, and yet it was thought that the daughter’s would exceed it; andso when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheldher but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greaternumber were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her ingreat seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her greatbeauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, heruncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage notonly by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by thepersons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man,though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be oldenough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had anyeye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl’s propertybrought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said inpraise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I wouldhave you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything istalked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am,that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishionersto speak well of him, especially in villages.”“That is the truth,” said Don Quixote; “but go on, for the story isvery good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.”“May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,” said Pedro; “that is theone to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put beforehis niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particularof the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry andmake a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any otheranswer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being soyoung she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. Atthese, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncleceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced inage and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he—and he saidquite right—parents are not to settle children in life against theirwill. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day thedemure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spiteof her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her,took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village,and tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, andher beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how manyrich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume ofChrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they saythat he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, becauseMarcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so littleor rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even thesemblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on thecontrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watchesover her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one hasboasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hopehowever small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoidor shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats themcourteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare hisintention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that ofmatrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kindof disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plaguehad got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the heartsof those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but herscorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so theyknow not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of hercharacter; and if you should remain here any time, señor, you wouldhear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of therejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot wherethere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one ofthem but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her loverwould say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all humanbeauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; therelove songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all thehours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,without having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in themorning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief orrespite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat ofthe sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionateheavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautifulMarcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that know her arewaiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the happyman that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gainingpossession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being suchwell-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the causeof Chrysostom’s death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I adviseyou, señor, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which willbe well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is nothalf a league from this place to where he directed he should beburied.”“I will make a point of it,” said Don Quixote, “and I thank you for thepleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.”“Oh,” said the goatherd, “I do not know even the half of what hashappened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall inwith some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be wellfor you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt yourwound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear ofan untoward result.”Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd’s loquacity at the devil, onhis part begged his master to go into Pedro’s hut to sleep. He did so,and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea,in imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himselfbetween Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had beendiscarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.c12e.jpg (42K)CHAPTER XIII.IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHERINCIDENTSc13a.jpg (181K)Full SizeBut hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of theeast, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tellhim that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial ofChrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desirednothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once,which he did with all despatch, and with the same they all set outforthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meetingof two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed inblack sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypressand bitter oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in hishand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback inhandsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanyingthem. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiringone of the other which way each party was going, they learned that allwere bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, “Itseems to me, Señor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delaywe shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable itcannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have toldus, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.”“So I think too,” replied Vivaldo, “and I would delay not to say a day,but four, for the sake of seeing it.”Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela andChrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had metthese shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion theyhad asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which oneof them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of ashepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,together with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they weregoing. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who wascalled Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him togo armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixotereplied, “The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to goin any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were inventedfor soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and madefor those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, thoughunworthy, am the least of all.”The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better tosettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldoproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.“Have not your worships,” replied Don Quixote, “read the annals andhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of KingArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus,with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly receivedall over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, butwas changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time heis to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for whichreason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishmanever killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this good king thatfamous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table wasinstituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the QueenGuinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between andconfidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quintañona, whencecame that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain—O never surely was there knight    So served by hand of dame,As served was he Sir Lancelot hight    When he from Britain came—with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in loveand war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry wenton extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of theworld; and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mightyAmadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifthgeneration, and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the neversufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost wehave seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianisof Greece. This, then, sirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I havespoken of is the order of his chivalry, of which, as I have alreadysaid, I, though a sinner, have made profession, and what the aforesaidknights professed that same do I profess, and so I go through thesesolitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in soul to oppose myarm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid ofthe weak and needy.”By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves ofDon Quixote’s being out of his senses and of the form of madness thatovermastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that allfelt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was aperson of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order tobeguile the short journey which they said was required to reach themountain, the scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity ofgoing on with his absurdities. So he said to him, “It seems to me,Señor Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of themost austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of theCarthusian monks is not so austere.”“As austere it may perhaps be,” replied our Don Quixote, “but sonecessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if thetruth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain ordersdoes no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare ofthe world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they prayfor, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of ourswords, not under shelter but in the open air, a target for theintolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts ofwinter. Thus are we God’s ministers on earth and the arms by which hisjustice is done therein. And as the business of war and all thatrelates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding greatsweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it theirprofession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquilpeace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I donot mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that theknight-errant’s calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; Iwould merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubta more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, awretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt thatthe knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of theirlives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to beemperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat;and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sagesto help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambitionand disappointed in their hopes.”“That is my own opinion,” replied the traveller; “but one thing amongmany others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is thatwhen they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilousadventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, theynever at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves toGod, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead ofwhich they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion asif these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhatof heathenism.”“Sir,” answered Don Quixote, “that cannot be on any account omitted,and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it isusual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who onengaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turnhis eyes towards her softly and lovingly, as though with thementreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he isabout to undertake, and even though no one hear him, he is bound to saycertain words between his teeth, commending himself to her with all hisheart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories. Noris it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commendingthemselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing sowhile they are engaged in their task.”“For all that,” answered the traveller, “I feel some doubt still,because often I have read how words will arise between twoknights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that theiranger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretchof field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed theycome to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commendthemselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter isthat one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through andthrough by his antagonist’s lance, and as for the other, it is only byholding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to theground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself toGod in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been betterif those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in themidst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as aChristian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have notladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love.”“That is impossible,” said Don Quixote: “I say it is impossible thatthere could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is asnatural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: mostcertainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found aknight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that withoutone he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one whohad gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not bythe door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.”“Nevertheless,” said the traveller, “if I remember rightly, I think Ihave read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet hewas not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.”To which our Don Quixote made answer, “Sir, one solitary swallow doesnot make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeplyin love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that tookhis fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, inshort, it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistressof his will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and verysecretly, for he prided himself on being a reticent knight.”“Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,”said the traveller, “it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being asreticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in thename of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name,country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herselffortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such aknight as your worship seems to be.”At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, “I cannot saypositively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the worldshould know I serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been socourteously asked of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country ElToboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of aprincess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman,since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which thepoets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs aregold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyessuns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neckalabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, andwhat modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rationalreflection can only extol, not compare.”“We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,” said Vivaldo.To which Don Quixote replied, “She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of theMoncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas orVillanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas,Alagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques,Mendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses ofPortugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage thatthough modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the mostillustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let nonedispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the footof the trophy of Orlando’s arms, saying,    These let none move    Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.”“Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,” said the traveller, “Iwill not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha,though, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reachedmy ears.”“What!” said Don Quixote, “has that never reached them?”The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to theconversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherdsperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. SanchoPanza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowingwho he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he feltany difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea delToboso, because neither any such name nor any such princess had evercome to his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They weregoing along conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gapbetween two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad insheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, asafterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress. Six ofthe number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowersand branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds said, “Those whocome there are the bearers of Chrysostom’s body, and the foot of thatmountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him.” Theytherefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time thosewho came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharppickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They greetedeach other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompaniedhim turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, theysaw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of onethirty years of age, and showing even in death that in life he had beenof comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on the bier itselfwere laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and those whowere looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all theothers who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of thosewho had borne the body said to another, “Observe carefully, Ambrosio ifthis is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that whathe directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.”“This is the place,” answered Ambrosio “for in it many a time did mypoor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he toldme, that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race,and here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, ashonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcelaended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of hiswretched life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, hedesired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.” Then turning toDon Quixote and the travellers he went on to say, “That body, sirs, onwhich you are looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soulon which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the bodyof Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy,unapproached in gentle bearing, a phœnix in friendship, generouswithout limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, inshort, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in allthat makes up misfortune. He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, hewas scorned; he wooed a wild beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursuedthe wind, he cried to the wilderness, he served ingratitude, and forreward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut shortby a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man, asthese papers which you see could fully prove, had he not commanded meto consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to theearth.”“You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their ownerhimself,” said Vivaldo, “for it is neither right nor proper to do thewill of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not havebeen reasonable in Augustus Cæsar had he permitted the directions leftby the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,Señor Ambrosio while you consign your friend’s body to the earth, youshould not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the orderin bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationallyobey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let thecruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to cometo all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all ofus who have come here know already the story of this your love-strickenand heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and thecause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of hislife; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty ofMarcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship,together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path thatinsane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death ofChrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity andpity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyesthat which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and inconsideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we mightby condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosio, or at least I on myown account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allowme to carry away some of them.”And without waiting for the shepherd’s answer, he stretched out hishand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing whichAmbrosio said, “Out of courtesy, señor, I will grant your request as tothose you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain fromburning the remainder.”Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one ofthem at once, and saw that its title was “Lay of Despair.”Ambrosio hearing it said, “That is the last paper the unhappy manwrote; and that you may see, señor, to what an end his misfortunesbrought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have timeenough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.”“I will do so very willingly,” said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanderswere equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loudvoice, found that it ran as follows.c13e.jpg (15K)CHAPTER XIV.WHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF THE DEAD SHEPHERD,TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FORc14a.jpg (172K)Full SizeTHE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOMSince thou dost in thy cruelty desireThe ruthless rigour of thy tyrannyFrom tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,The very Hell will I constrain to lendThis stricken breast of mine deep notes of woeTo serve my need of fitting utterance.And as I strive to body forth the taleOf all I suffer, all that thou hast done,Forth shall the dread voice roll, and bear alongShreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.Then listen, not to dulcet harmony,But to a discord wrung by mad despairOut of this bosom’s depths of bitterness,To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.The lion’s roar, the fierce wolf’s savage howl,The horrid hissing of the scaly snake,The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,The crow’s ill-boding croak, the hollow moanOf wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,The envied owl’s sad note, the wail of woeThat rises from the dreary choir of Hell,Commingled in one sound, confusing sense,Let all these come to aid my soul’s complaint,For pain like mine demands new modes of song.No echoes of that discord shall be heardWhere Father Tagus rolls, or on the banksOf olive-bordered Betis; to the rocksOr in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,And by a lifeless tongue in living words;Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores,Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;Or in among the poison-breathing swarmsOf monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.For, though it be to solitudes remoteThe hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows soundThy matchless cruelty, my dismal fateShall carry them to all the spacious world.Disdain hath power to kill, and patience diesSlain by suspicion, be it false or true;And deadly is the force of jealousy;Long absence makes of life a dreary void;No hope of happiness can give reposeTo him that ever fears to be forgot;And death, inevitable, waits in hall.But I, by some strange miracle, live onA prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;Racked by suspicion as by certainty;Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone.And while I suffer thus, there comes no rayOf hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;Nor do I look for it in my despair;But rather clinging to a cureless woe,All hope do I abjure for evermore.Can there be hope where fear is? Were it well,When far more certain are the grounds of fear?Ought I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears?Who would not give free access to distrust,Seeing disdain unveiled, and—bitter change!—All his suspicions turned to certainties,And the fair truth transformed into a lie?Oh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love,Oh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands,And bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.But, woe is me! triumphant over all,My sufferings drown the memory of you.And now I die, and since there is no hopeOf happiness for me in life or death,Still to my fantasy I’ll fondly cling.I’ll say that he is wise who loveth well,And that the soul most free is that most boundIn thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.I’ll say that she who is mine enemyIn that fair body hath as fair a mind,And that her coldness is but my desert,And that by virtue of the pain he sendsLove rules his kingdom with a gentle sway.Thus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore,And wearing out the wretched shred of lifeTo which I am reduced by her disdain,I’ll give this soul and body to the winds,All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.Thou whose injustice hath supplied the causeThat makes me quit the weary life I loathe,As by this wounded bosom thou canst seeHow willingly thy victim I become,Let not my death, if haply worth a tear,Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes;I would not have thee expiate in aughtThe crime of having made my heart thy prey;But rather let thy laughter gaily ringAnd prove my death to be thy festival.Fool that I am to bid thee! well I knowThy glory gains by my untimely end.And now it is the time; from Hell’s abyssCome thirsting Tantalus, come SisyphusHeaving the cruel stone, come TityusWith vulture, and with wheel Ixion come,And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil;And all into this breast transfer their pains,And (if such tribute to despair be due)Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirgeOver a corse unworthy of a shroud.Let the three-headed guardian of the gate,And all the monstrous progeny of hell,The doleful concert join: a lover deadMethinks can have no fitter obsequies.Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art goneForth from this sorrowing heart: my miseryBrings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth;Then banish sadness even in the tomb.The “Lay of Chrysostom” met with the approbation of the listeners,though the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he hadheard of Marcela’s reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained init of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of thegood name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one whoknew well his friend’s most secret thoughts, “Señor, to remove thatdoubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he wasaway from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, totry if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everythingdistresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginaryjealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormentedChrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue ofMarcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not andcannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, andvery scornful.”“That is true,” said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paperof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellousvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to theireyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the gravethere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beautyexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazedupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to seeher were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. Butthe instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifestindignation:“Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see ifin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched beingthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel workof thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero tolook down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or inthy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungratefuldaughter trampled on her father Tarquin’s? Tell us quickly for whatthou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know thethoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will makeall these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though he bedead.”“I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named,” repliedMarcela, “but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are allthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom’s death; andtherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, forit will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home topersons of sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and somuch so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; andfor the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound tolove you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I knowthat everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, byreason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound tolove that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of thatwhich is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it isvery absurd to say, “I love thee because thou art beautiful, thou mustlove me though I be ugly.” But supposing the beauty equal on bothsides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be thereforealike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasingthe eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beautyexcited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to andfro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity ofbeautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and truelove, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary andnot compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desireme to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say youlove me? Nay—tell me—had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made mebeautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice ofmine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me withoutmy asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it,does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is agift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; forbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword;the one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not cometoo near. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, withoutwhich the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful;but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace andcharm to mind and body, why should she who is loved for her beauty partwith it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all hismight and energy to rob her of it? I was born free, and that I mightlive in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of themountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are mymirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts andcharms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I haveinspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived,and if their longings live on hope—and I have given none to Chrysostomor to any other—it cannot justly be said that the death of any is mydoing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killedhim; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes werehonourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answerthat when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared tome his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetualsolitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of myretirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal,he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, whatwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If Ihad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I shouldhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He waspersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated.Bethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laidto my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give wayto despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatterhimself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; butlet not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, uponwhom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It hasnot been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and toexpect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general declaration servefor each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be understoodfrom this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousyor misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause forjealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Lethim who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as somethingnoxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold hisservice; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls mecruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, thisungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve,know, or follow them. If Chrysostom’s impatience and violent passionkilled him, why should my modest behaviour and circumspection beblamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why shouldhe who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? Ihave, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; mytaste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neitherlove nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, ortrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of theshepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are myrecreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if theyever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, stepsby which the soul travels to its primeval abode.”With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned andpassed into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving allwho were there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of herbeauty. Some—those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by herbright eyes—made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frankdeclaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fittingoccasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,Don Quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in aloud and distinct voice:“Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow thebeautiful Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. Shehas shown by clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no faultis to be found with her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how farshe is from yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for whichreason, instead of being followed and persecuted, she should in justicebe honoured and esteemed by all the good people of the world, for sheshows that she is the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuousresolution.”Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or becauseAmbrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none ofthe shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished thegrave and burned Chrysostom’s papers, they laid his body in it, notwithout many tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave witha heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant tohave prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:Beneath the stone before your eyesThe body of a lover lies;In life he was a shepherd swain,In death a victim to disdain.Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,Was she that drove him to despair,And Love hath made her his allyFor spreading wide his tyranny.They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches,and all expressing their condolence with his friend Ambrosio, tooktheir leave. Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixotebade farewell to his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him tocome with them to Seville, as being such a convenient place for findingadventures, for they presented themselves in every street and roundevery corner oftener than anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them fortheir advice and for the disposition they showed to do him a favour,and said that for the present he would not, and must not go to Sevilleuntil he had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers, ofwhom report said they were full. Seeing his good intention, thetravellers were unwilling to press him further, and once more biddinghim farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course ofwhich they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostomas well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, resolved to goin quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her of all theservice he could render her; but things did not fall out with him as heexpected, according to what is related in the course of this veracioushistory, of which the Second Part ends here.c14e.jpg (31K)CHAPTER XV.IN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL INWITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANSc15a.jpg (81K)Full SizeThe sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote tookleave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial ofChrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they hadseen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for morethan two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside whichran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to passthere the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginningto come on oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turningRocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there inabundance, they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony verypeacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what theyfound in them.c15b.jpg (376K)Full SizeSancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feelingsure, from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence,that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into animpropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep,so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove ofGalician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way itis to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots wheregrass and water abound; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suitedthe Yanguesans’ purpose very well. It so happened, then, that Rocinantetook a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, andabandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, withoutasking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastenedto make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferredtheir pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth tosuch effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked withouta saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was thatthe carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, camerunning up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they broughthim sorely battered to the ground.By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing ofRocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:“So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but basefolk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me intaking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before oureyes.”“What the devil vengeance can we take,” answered Sancho, “if they aremore than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not morethan one and a half?”“I count for a hundred,” replied Don Quixote, and without more words hedrew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled bythe example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, DonQuixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leatherjerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. TheYanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they wereso many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two intothe middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, atthe second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixotefared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing,and fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, whohad not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes canpound in angry boorish hands.c15c.jpg (362K)Full SizeThen, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all thehaste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leavingthe two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to hismaster he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, “Señor DonQuixote, ah, Señor Don Quixote!”“What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?” answered Don Quixote in the samefeeble suffering tone as Sancho.“I would like, if it were possible,” answered Sancho Panza, “yourworship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas,if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve forbroken bones as well as for wounds.”“If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?”said Don Quixote; “but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of aknight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise,I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost itscunning.”“But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of ourfeet?” answered Sancho Panza.“For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,” said the batteredknight Don Quixote; “but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had nobusiness to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knightslike myself, and so I believe that in punishment for havingtransgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted thischastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brotherSancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which Iam now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to thewelfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabble of thissort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword againstthem, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastisethem to thy heart’s content, and if any knights come to their aid anddefence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all mymight; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs whatthe might of this strong arm of mine is equal to”—so uplifted had thepoor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master’s admonition as tolet it pass without saying in reply, “Señor, I am a man of peace, meekand quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife andchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to yourworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I drawsword either against clown or against knight, and that here before GodI forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they havebeen, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, nobleor commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.”To all which his master said in reply, “I wish I had breath enough tospeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side wouldabate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.Come now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse,should turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so thatsafely and without impediment we put into port in some one of thoseislands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winningit I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossiblethrough not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, norpossessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thylordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms andprovinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so welldisposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making somemove to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance maydo for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have goodsense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself,whatever may befall him.”“In what has now befallen us,” answered Sancho, “I’d have been wellpleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters thanfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us helpRocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause ofall this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him tobe a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say rightthat it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there isnothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mightyslashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there wascoming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a greatstorm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?”“And yet thine, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “ought to be used to suchsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plainthey must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were notthat I imagine—why do I say imagine?—know of a certainty that all theseannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, Iwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation.”To this the squire replied, “Señor, as these mishaps are what one reapsof chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have theirown fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that aftertwo harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in hisinfinite mercy helps us.”“Know, friend Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “that the life ofknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, andneither more nor less is it within immediate possibility forknights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown inthe case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughlyacquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, ofsome who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I havementioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced diversmisfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himselfin the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it ispositively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than twohundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of thepillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author ofno small authority who says that the Knight of Phœbus, being caught ina certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, onfalling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had notbeen succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his,it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well sufferin company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would havethee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happenby chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down inthe law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobblerstrikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be infact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom hestruck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldstimagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we havetherefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, withwhich they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not oneof them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.”“They gave me no time to see that much,” answered Sancho, “for hardlyhad I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulderswith their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyesand the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, andwhere thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity ornot gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for theywill remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.”“For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,” said Don Quixote, “thatthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no painwhich death does not remove.”“And what greater misfortune can there be,” replied Panza, “than theone that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? Ifour mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,it would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all theplasters in a hospital almost won’t be enough to put us right.”“No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean todo,” returned Don Quixote, “and let us see how Rocinante is, for itseems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to thelot of the poor beast.”“There is nothing wonderful in that,” replied Sancho, “since he is aknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have comeoff scot-free where we come out scotched.”“Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bringrelief to it,” said Don Quixote; “I say so because this little beastmay now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castlewhere I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it anydishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good oldSilenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when heentered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted ona handsome ass.”“It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,” answeredSancho, “but there is a great difference between going mounted andgoing slung like a sack of manure.”To which Don Quixote replied, “Wounds received in battle confer honourinstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as Itold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thybeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence erenight come on and surprise us in these wilds.”“And yet I have heard your worship say,” observed Panza, “that it isvery meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and thatthey esteem it very good fortune.”“That is,” said Don Quixote, “when they cannot help it, or when theyare in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who haveremained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all theinclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it;and one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, hetook up his abode on the Peña Pobre for—I know not if it was eightyears or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at anyrate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique thePrincess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, andmake haste before a mishap like Rocinante’s befalls the ass.”“The very devil would be in it in that case,” said Sancho; and lettingoff thirty “ohs,” and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twentymaledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought himthere, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bowwithout power to bring himself upright, but with all his pains hesaddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to theexcessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as forhim, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neitherSancho nor his master would have been behind him.c15d.jpg (329K)Full SizeTo be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinantewith a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceededmore or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high roadmight be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them fromgood to better, he had not gone a short league when the road came insight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to thedelight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that itwas an inn, and his master that it was not one, but a castle, and thedispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had timeto reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without anyfurther controversy.c15e.jpg (31K)CHAPTER XVI.OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TOBE A CASTLEc16a.jpg (129K)Full SizeThe innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sanchowhat was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only thathe had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. Theinnkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of hercalling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt forthe sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending DonQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her intaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, anAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of oneeye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to besure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms fromhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, madeher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass,then, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for DonQuixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly servedfor many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered acarrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote’s, and,though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had muchthe advantage of it, as Don Quixote’s consisted simply of four roughboards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinnessmight have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they notseen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemedpebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverletthe threads of which anyone that chose might have counted withoutmissing one in the reckoning.On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess andher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, whileMaritornes—for that was the name of the Asturian—held the light forthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full ofwheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more thelook of blows than of a fall.It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points andprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. “Pray, señora,”he added, “manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someoneto use it, for my loins too are rather sore.”“Then you must have fallen too,” said the hostess.“I did not fall,” said Sancho Panza, “but from the shock I got atseeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had athousand thwacks.”“That may well be,” said the young girl, “for it has many a timehappened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and nevercoming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself asweak and shaken as if I had really fallen.”“There is the point, señora,” replied Sancho Panza, “that I withoutdreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself withscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.”“How is the gentleman called?” asked Maritornes the Asturian.“Don Quixote of La Mancha,” answered Sancho Panza, “and he is aknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seenin the world this long time past.”“What is a knight-adventurer?” said the lass.“Are you so new in the world as not to know?” answered Sancho Panza.“Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thingthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the mostmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two orthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.”“Then how is it,” said the hostess, “that belonging to so good a masteras this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as acounty?”“It is too soon yet,” answered Sancho, “for we have only been a monthgoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing thatcan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked foranother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well ofthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would notchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.”To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively,and sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess bythe hand he said to her, “Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourselffortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, whichis such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what iscommonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform youwho I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed onmy memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you mygratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held menot so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fairingrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovelydamsel might be the masters of my liberty.”The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened inbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understoodabout as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though theycould perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will andblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, theystared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a manof a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him inpothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gaveher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and thefamily asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishesunreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never madepromises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made themin a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herselfgreatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such anemployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes andill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,rickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-litstable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted ofa rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvasrather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the carrier,made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings ofthe two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek,plump, and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers ofArévalo, according to the author of this history, who particularlymentions this carrier because he knew him very well, and they even saywas in some degree a relation of his; besides which Cid HameteBenengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in all things,as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those thathave been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant theymight be, an example that might be followed by those grave historianswho relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get ataste of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstandfrom carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings onthe author of “Tablante de Ricamonte” and that of the other book inwhich the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with whatminuteness they describe everything!To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given themtheir second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddlesand lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by thistime plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep thepain of his ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain ofhis had his eyes as wide open as a hare’s.c16b.jpg (333K)Full SizeThe inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no lightexcept that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of thegateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present toour knight’s mind, of the incidents described at every turn in thebooks that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to hisimagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, whichwas that he fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, ashas been said, all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), andthat the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of thecastle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in lovewith him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while that nightwithout the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy thathe had constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and toconsider the perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, andhe resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea delToboso, even though the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintañonashould present themselves before him.While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and thehour—an unlucky one for him—arrived for the Asturian to come, who inher smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif,with noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the threewere quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gainedthe door when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed inspite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out hisarms to receive his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went alldoubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for herlover, encountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly bythe wrist, and drawing her towards him, while she dared not utter aword, made her sit down on the bed. He then felt her smock, andalthough it was of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest andsoftest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass beads, but to him theyhad the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair, which in somemeasure resembled a horse’s mane, he rated as threads of the brightestgold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her breath,which no doubt smelt of yesterday’s stale salad, seemed to him todiffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, hedrew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in thesame style as that which he had seen in his books of the otherprincesses who, smitten by love, came with all the adornments that arehere set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was thepoor gentleman’s blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anythingelse about the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit,were enough to undeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he hadthe goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasphe went on to say in low, tender voice:“Would that I found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position torepay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your greatbeauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary ofpersecuting the good, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lieso bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly complywith yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility another yetgreater is to be added, which is the faith that I have pledged to thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; andwere it not that this stood in the way I should not be so insensible aknight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness hasoffered me.”Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast byDon Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed toher, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the momentshe entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixotesaid; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word withhim for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote’s bed and stood still tosee what would come of this talk which he could not understand; butwhen he perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixotestriving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm anddelivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knightthat he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content with this hemounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pacerather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and notvery firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight of thecarrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this theinnkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl ofMaritornes’, because after calling loudly to her he got no answer. Withthis suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarterwhere he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her masterwas coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened andpanic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, andcrouching upon it made a ball of herself.The innkeeper came in exclaiming, “Where art thou, strumpet? Of coursethis is some of thy work.” At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this massalmost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began todistribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell uponMaritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paidback so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite ofhimself. He then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not,raising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, andhe and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage inthe world. The carrier, however, perceiving by the light of theinnkeeper candle how it fared with his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote,ran to bring her the help she needed; and the innkeeper did the samebut with a different intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as hebelieved that beyond a doubt she alone was the cause of all theharmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope tostick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and theinnkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not givethemselves a moment’s rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper’slamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on oneupon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a soundspot left where a hand could light.It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn acaudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who,also hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staffand the tin case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark intothe room crying: “Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in thename of the Holy Brotherhood!”The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who laystretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his handfalling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, “Help forthe Jurisdiction!” but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of didnot move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in theroom were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voicestill higher, calling out, “Shut the inn gate; see that no one goesout; they have killed a man here!” This cry startled them all, and eachdropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached him. Theinnkeeper retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, thelass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unableto move from where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go DonQuixote’s beard, and went out to look for a light to search for andapprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper hadpurposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he wascompelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time andtrouble he lit another lamp.c16e.jpg (32K)CHAPTER XVII.IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DONQUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TOHIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLEc17a.jpg (87K)Full SizeBy this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the sametone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before whenhe lay stretched “in the vale of the stakes,” he began calling to himnow, “Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friendSancho?”“How can I sleep, curses on it!” returned Sancho discontentedly andbitterly, “when it is plain that all the devils have been at me thisnight?”“Thou mayest well believe that,” answered Don Quixote, “because, eitherI know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know—but thisthat I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret untilafter my death.”“I swear it,” answered Sancho.“I say so,” continued Don Quixote, “because I hate taking away anyone’sgood name.”“I say,” replied Sancho, “that I swear to hold my tongue about it tillthe end of your worship’s days, and God grant I may be able to let itout to-morrow.”“Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thouwouldst see me dead so soon?”“It is not for that,” replied Sancho, “but because I hate keepingthings long, and I don’t want them to grow rotten with me fromover-keeping.”“At any rate,” said Don Quixote, “I have more confidence in thyaffection and good nature; and so I would have thee know that thisnight there befell me one of the strangest adventures that I coulddescribe, and to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a littlewhile ago the daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and thatshe is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in thewide world. What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of herlively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I oweto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and insilence! I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of sogreat a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and thisis more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted,at the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorousdiscourse with her, there came, without my seeing or knowing whence itcame, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted sucha cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and thenpummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterdaywhen the carriers, on account of Rocinante’s misbehaviour, inflicted onus the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must besome enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel’s beauty, andthat it is not for me.”“Not for me either,” said Sancho, “for more than four hundred Moorshave so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes andfancy-bread to it. But tell me, señor, what do you call this excellentand rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though yourworship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparablebeauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacksI think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!for I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all themishaps, the greater part falls to my share.”“Then thou hast been thrashed too?” said Don Quixote.“Didn’t I say so? worse luck to my line!” said Sancho.“Be not distressed, friend,” said Don Quixote, “for I will now make theprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling ofan eye.”By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, andcame in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sanchocaught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with acloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbiddingcountenance, he said to his master, “Señor, can it be that this is theenchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there beanything still left in the ink-bottle?”“It cannot be the Moor,” answered Don Quixote, “for those underenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.”“If they don’t let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,”said Sancho; “if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.”“Mine could speak too,” said Don Quixote, “but that is not a sufficientreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.”The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peacefulconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still layon his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. Theofficer turned to him and said, “Well, how goes it, good man?”“I would speak more politely if I were you,” replied Don Quixote; “isit the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, youbooby?”The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such asorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full ofoil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave hima badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, andSancho Panza said, “That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Señor, and hekeeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs andlamp-whacks.”“That is the truth,” answered Don Quixote, “and there is no use introubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry orvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find noone on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thoucanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me alittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,for indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losingmuch blood from the wound that phantom gave me.”Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after theinnkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to seewhat had become of his enemy, he said to him, “Señor, whoever you are,do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,and wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant onearth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchantedMoor that is in this inn.”When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man outof his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. Thehost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to DonQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of theblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a coupleof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweatthat flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To bebrief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing themall and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had cometo perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and asthere was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tinoil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and overthe flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many moreave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross byway of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, theinnkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefullyengaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on thespot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, andso he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask andremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely hadhe done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing wasleft in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he brokeinto a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up andleave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than threehours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily reliefand so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,and verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and thatwith this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face anykind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master asmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, whichwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it withboth hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down anddrained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that thestomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of hismaster, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings andretchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly hebelieved his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked andtormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, “It is my belief, Sancho,that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I ampersuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.”“If your worship knew that,” returned Sancho—“woe betide me and all mykindred!—why did you let me taste it?”At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began todischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he hadthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit fornothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms andconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his endhad come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at theend of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak andexhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as hasbeen said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take hisdeparture at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that allthe time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in itwho stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he hadthe security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged bythis impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle onhis squire’s beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;after which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn helaid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stoodwatching him; the innkeeper’s daughter was likewise observing him, andhe too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched asigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but theyall thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any ratethey who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called tothe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, “Many and greatare the favours, Señor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle ofyours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to youfor them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging youof any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling isno other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and tochastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of thiskind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order ofknighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction andreparation to the utmost of your desire.”The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, “Sir Knight, I do notwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is doneme I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want isthat you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night,as well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper andbeds.”c16c.jpg (326K)Full Size“Then this is an inn?” said Don Quixote.“And a very respectable one,” said the innkeeper.“I have been under a mistake all this time,” answered Don Quixote, “forin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since itappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now isthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule ofknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I haveread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging oranything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality thatmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for theinsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and byday, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger andthirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven andall the hardships of earth.”“I have little to do with that,” replied the innkeeper; “pay me whatyou owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I careabout is to get my money.”“You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,” said Don Quixote, and puttingspurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out ofthe inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distancewithout looking to see if his squire was following him.The innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get paymentof Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule andreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not payinganything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed verywroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that hewould not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalryhis master had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him hislife; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was notgoing to be violated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yetto come into the world ever complain of him or reproach him withbreaking so just a privilege.The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among thecompany in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, threeneedle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fairof Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, andplayful, who, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse,made up to Sancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of themwent in for the blanket of the host’s bed; but on flinging him into itthey looked up, and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower thanwhat they required for their work, they decided upon going out into theyard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in themiddle of the blanket, they began to raise him high, making sport withhim as they would with a dog at Shrovetide.c16d.jpg (285K)Full SizeThe cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reachedthe ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, waspersuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearlyperceived that it was his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about hecame up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and finding it shut wentround it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon ashe came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, he discoveredthe game that was being played with his squire. He saw him rising andfalling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his rageallowed him, it is my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climbfrom his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was so bruised andbattered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of hishorse he began to utter such maledictions and objurgations againstthose who were blanketing Sancho as it would be impossible to writedown accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or theirwork for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his lamentations,mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to littlepurpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. Theythen brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put hisjacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him soexhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that itmight be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it,and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries ofhis master exclaiming, “Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not,my son, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (andhe held up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thouwilt certainly be restored.”At these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still loudervoice said, “Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not aknight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have leftafter last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, andleave me to myself!” and at one and the same instant he left offtalking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it waswater he did not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetchhim some wine, which she did with right good will, and paid for it withher own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she was in thatline of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to aChristian about her. When Sancho had done drinking he dug his heelsinto his ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed outvery well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, thoughit had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It istrue that the innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what wasowing to him, but Sancho took his departure in such a flurry that henever missed them. The innkeeper, as soon as he saw him off, wanted tobar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for theywere fellows who would not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote,even had he been really one of the knights-errant of the Round Table.c17e.jpg (47K)CHAPTER XVIII.IN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER,DON QUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATINGc18a.jpg (79K)Full SizeSancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge onhis beast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, “I havenow come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn isbeyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociouslydiverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beingsof another world? and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that whenI was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy,it was out of my power to mount upon it, nor could I even dismount fromRocinante, because they no doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to theeby the faith of what I am that if I had been able to climb up ordismount, I would have avenged thee in such a way that those braggartthieves would have remembered their freak for ever, even though in sodoing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, which, as I haveoften told thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him who is notone, save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his ownlife and person.”“I would have avenged myself too if I could,” said Sancho, “whether Ihad been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I ampersuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms orenchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone likeourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name themwhen they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, andanother Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called JuanPalomeque the Left-handed; so that, señor, your not being able to leapover the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of somethingelse besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all thisis, that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us intosuch misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; andthat the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would befor us to return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to ourbusiness, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail tobucket, as the saying is.”“How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote;“hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shaltsee with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in thepursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can therebe in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle,and triumphing over one’s enemy? None, beyond all doubt.”“Very likely,” answered Sancho, “though I do not know it; all I know isthat since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has beenone (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable anumber) we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan,and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half ahelmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings andmore cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing overand above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannotavenge myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it,of conquering an enemy is like.”“That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,” repliedDon Quixote; “but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand somesword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effectupon him who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune mayprocure for me that which belonged to Amadis when he was called ‘TheKnight of the Burning Sword,’ which was one of the best swords thatever knight in the world possessed, for, besides having the saidvirtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however strongand enchanted it might be, that could resist it.”“Such is my luck,” said Sancho, “that even if that happened and yourworship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn outserviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,they might sup sorrow.”“Fear not that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote: “Heaven will deal better bythee.”Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on theroad they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them alarge and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho andsaid:“This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune isreserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on anyother shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall dodeeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages tocome. Seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, allthat is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countlessnations that comes marching there.”“According to that there must be two,” said Sancho, “for on thisopposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust.”Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicingexceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage andencounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times andseasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures,crazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books ofchivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to suchthings. Now the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two greatdroves of sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions,which, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drewnear, but Don Quixote asserted so positively that they were armies thatSancho was led to believe it and say, “Well, and what are we to do,señor?”c17b.jpg (339K)Full Size“What?” said Don Quixote: “give aid and assistance to the weak andthose who need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comesopposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron,lord of the great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind meis that of his enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the BareArm, for he always goes into battle with his right arm bare.”“But why are these two lords such enemies?”“They are at enmity,” replied Don Quixote, “because this Alifanfaron isa furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who isa very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and herfather is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he firstabandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts hisown.”“By my beard,” said Sancho, “but Pentapolin does quite right, and Iwill help him as much as I can.”“In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “forto engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbedknight.”“That I can well understand,” answered Sancho; “but where shall we putthis ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for Ibelieve it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beastof this kind.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and what you had best do with him isto leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for thehorses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that evenRocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend tome and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chiefknights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the bettersee and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder,whence both armies may be seen.”They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which thetwo droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seenif the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded thesight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see andwhat did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:“That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears uponhis shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is thevaliant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour withflowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on anazure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; thatother of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntlessBrandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armourwears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according totradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to theground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turnthine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in thevan of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonelof Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with armsquartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cator on a field tawny with a motto which says _Miau_, which is thebeginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is thepeerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; theother, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger andbears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, isa novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord ofthe baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikesthe flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bearsazure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque,who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto inCastilian that says, _‘Rastrea mi suerte’_.” And so he went on naming anumber of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination,and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, andmottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; andwithout a pause, he continued, “People of divers nations compose thissquadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of thefamous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those thatsift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famedcool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and variousways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians,faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, theParthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that evershift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, theEthiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whosefeatures I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. Inthis other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streamsof the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenanceswith the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice inthe fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesianplains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in theElysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy earsof corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those thatbathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feedtheir herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famedfor its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pinecladPyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, asmany as all Europe includes and contains.”Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving toeach its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful andsaturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hungupon his words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try ifhe could see the knights and giants his master was describing, and ashe could not make out one of them he said to him:“Señor, devil take it if there’s a sign of any man you talk of, knightor giant, in the whole thing; maybe it’s all enchantment, like thephantoms last night.”“How canst thou say that!” answered Don Quixote; “dost thou not hearthe neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll ofthe drums?”“I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,” said Sancho;which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.“The fear thou art in, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “prevents thee fromseeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is toderange the senses and make things appear different from what they are;if thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself,for alone I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall givemy aid;” and so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting thelance in rest, shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shoutedafter him, crying, “Come back, Señor Don Quixote; I vow to God they aresheep and ewes you are charging! Come back! Unlucky the father thatbegot me! what madness is this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight,nor cats, nor arms, nor shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure orbedevilled. What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!” But notfor all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary hewent on shouting out, “Ho, knights, ye who follow and fight under thebanners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow meall; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over hisenemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.”So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and beganspearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he weretransfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and droversaccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones asbig as one’s fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, lettingdrive right and left kept saying:“Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a singleknight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make theeyield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiantPentapolin Garamanta.” Here came a sugar-plum from the brook thatstruck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feelinghimself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded forcertain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and puttingit to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere hehad succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there cameanother almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairlythat it smashed it to pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grindersout of his mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of hishand. Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that thepoor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his horse. Theshepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him; so in all hastethey collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of whichthere were more than seven, and made off without waiting to ascertainanything further.All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats hismaster was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour andthe occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him,then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had takenthemselves off, he ran to him and found him in very bad case, thoughnot unconscious; and said he:“Did I not tell you to come back, Señor Don Quixote; and that what youwere going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?”“That’s how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsifythings,” answered Don Quixote; “thou must know, Sancho, that it is avery easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what theychoose; and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of theglory he knew I was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons ofthe enemy into droves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg ofthee, Sancho, to undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true;mount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt see that whenthey have gone some little distance from this they will return to theiroriginal shape and, ceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects asI described them to thee at first. But go not just yet, for I want thyhelp and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth andgrinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in mymouth.”Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; nowjust at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote,so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, hedischarged all its contents with more force than a musket, and fullinto the beard of the compassionate squire.“Holy Mary!” cried Sancho, “what is this that has happened me? Clearlythis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;”but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by thecolour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from theflask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such aloathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over hisvery master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to hisass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve hismaster, out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh tookleave of his senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolvedto quit his master and return home, even though he forfeited the wagesof his service and all hopes of the promised island.Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keephis teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold ofthe bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master’sside—so loyal and well-behaved was he—and betook himself to where thesquire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like onein deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixotesaid to him:“Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless hedoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signsthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well withus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and henceit follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nighat hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes whichhappen to me, since thou hast no share in them.”“How have I not?” replied Sancho; “was he whom they blanketed yesterdayperchance any other than my father’s son? and the alforjas that aremissing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other butmyself?”“What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.“Yes, they are missing,” answered Sancho.“In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,” replied Don Quixote.“It would be so,” answered Sancho, “if there were none of the herbsyour worship says you know in these meadows, those with whichknights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-likeshortcomings.”“For all that,” answered Don Quixote, “I would rather have just now aquarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards’ heads, than allthe herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna’s notes.Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,for God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especiallywhen we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not themidges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of thewater, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the goodand on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.”“Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,” saidSancho.“Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,” said DonQuixote; “for there were knights-errant in former times as wellqualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of anencampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris;whereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor thepen the lance.”“Well, be it as your worship says,” replied Sancho; “let us be off nowand find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may besomewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms,nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the wholeconcern.”“Ask that of God, my son,” said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on wherethou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reachme here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of myteeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw,for it is there I feel the pain.”Sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, “How manygrinders used your worship have on this side?”“Four,” replied Don Quixote, “besides the back-tooth, all whole andquite sound.”“Mind what you are saying, señor.”“I say four, if not five,” answered Don Quixote, “for never in my lifehave I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or beendestroyed by any decay or rheum.”“Well, then,” said Sancho, “in this lower side your worship has no morethan two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor anyat all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.”“Luckless that I am!” said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squiregave him; “I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not thesword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like amill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than adiamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable toall this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee atwhatever pace thou wilt.”Sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which hethought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which wasthere very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slowpace—for the pain in Don Quixote’s jaws kept him uneasy andill-disposed for speed—Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert himby talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was thatwhich will be told in the following chapter.c18e.jpg (44K)CHAPTER XIX.OF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THEADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLEOCCURRENCES“It seems to me, señor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us oflate have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committedby your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oathyou made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, andall the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you hadtaken that helmet of Malandrino’s, or whatever the Moor is called, forI do not very well remember.”“Thou art very right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but to tell thetruth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon itthat the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault innot reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there areways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry.”“Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?” said Sancho.“It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,” said DonQuixote; “suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity;and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with aremedy.”“In that case,” said Sancho, “mind that your worship does not forgetthis as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into theirheads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worshipif they see you so obstinate.”While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the roadbefore they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and whatmade it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with theloss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder andcommissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventurewhich without any invention had really the appearance of one. It sohappened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all thatthey pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king’shighway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a leagueor two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squirehungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the roadthey were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly likestars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor didDon Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by thehalter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still,watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and foundthat the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came thegreater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like aman dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote’s hair stood on end; he,however, plucking up spirit a little, said:“This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure,in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour andresolution.”“Unlucky me!” answered Sancho; “if this adventure happens to be one ofphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribsto bear it?”“Be they phantoms ever so much,” said Don Quixote, “I will not permitthem to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks withthee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls ofthe yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able towield my sword as I please.”“And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,” saidSancho, “what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?”“For all that,” replied Don Quixote, “I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep agood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.”“I will, please God,” answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one sideof the road set themselves to observe closely what all these movinglights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twentyencamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, theawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage ofSancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit ofan ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more whenthey perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter coveredover with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourningdown to the very feet of their mules—for they could perceive plainlythey were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as theencamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintivetone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitaryplace was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho’s heart, and eveninto his master’s; and (save in Don Quixote’s case) did so, for allSancho’s resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite withhis master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to himvividly as one of the adventures of his books.He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was bornesome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reservedfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance inrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit andbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where theencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near athand he raised his voice and said:“Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who yeare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or somewrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that Ishould know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflictedupon you.”“We are in haste,” answered one of the encamisados, “and the inn is faroff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;”and spurring his mule he moved on.Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the muleby the bridle he said, “Halt, and be more mannerly, and render anaccount of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,all of you.”The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized thatrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. Anattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuseDon Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying hislance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badlywounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others theagility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, forit seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, solightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timidfolk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray andset off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, lookingexactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. Themourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, wereunable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself DonQuixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, forthey all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry awaythe dead body they had in the litter.Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,and said to himself, “Clearly this master of mine is as bold andvaliant as he says he is.”A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule hadthrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming upto him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on himto yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which theprostrate man replied, “I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir,for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christiangentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege,for I am a licentiate and I hold first orders.”“Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?” said DonQuixote.“What, señor?” said the other. “My bad luck.”“Then still worse awaits you,” said Don Quixote, “if you do not satisfyme as to all I asked you at first.”“You shall be soon satisfied,” said the licentiate; “you must know,then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only abachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, Icome from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same whofled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segoviaaccompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of agentleman who died in Baeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said,we are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia,where he was born.”“And who killed him?” asked Don Quixote.“God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,” answered thebachelor.“In that case,” said Don Quixote, “the Lord has relieved me of the taskof avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew himhaving slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrugone’s shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and Iwould have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, DonQuixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the worldrighting wrongs and redressing injuries.”“I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,” said thebachelor, “for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me witha broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days ofits life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been toleave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever;and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go insearch of adventures.”“Things do not all happen in the same way,” answered Don Quixote; “itall came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, bynight, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying,covered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something eviland of the other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty inattacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I knownpositively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainlybelieved and took you to be.”“As my fate has so willed it,” said the bachelor, “I entreat you, sirknight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to helpme to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught betweenthe stirrup and the saddle.”“I would have talked on till to-morrow,” said Don Quixote; “how longwere you going to wait before telling me of your distress?”He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as hewas just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden withprovender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sanchomade a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, andas the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obeyhis master’s call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under themule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and DonQuixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon ofthem on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.And said Sancho, “If by chance these gentlemen should want to know whowas the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he isthe famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of theRueful Countenance.”The bachelor then took his departure.I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,“Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent handson a holy thing, _juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo_.”“I do not understand that Latin,” answered Don Quixote, “but I knowwell I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think Iwas committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which,like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere,but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, Iremember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of theambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, whoexcommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivarbore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight.”On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had inducedhim to call him the “Knight of the Rueful Countenance” more then thanat any other time.“I will tell you,” answered Sancho; “it was because I have been lookingat you for some time by the light of the torch held by thatunfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the mostill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to thefatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.”“It is not that,” replied Don Quixote, “but because the sage whose dutyit will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought itproper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yoredid; one being ‘He of the Burning Sword,’ another ‘He of the Unicorn,’this one ‘He of the Damsels,’ that ‘He of the Phœnix,’ another ‘TheKnight of the Griffin,’ and another ‘He of the Death,’ and by thesenames and designations they were known all the world round; and so Isay that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mindjust now to call me ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,’ as I intendto call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit mebetter, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very ruefulcountenance painted on my shield.”“There is no occasion, señor, for wasting time or money on making thatcountenance,” said Sancho; “for all that need be done is for yourworship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, andwithout anything more, either image or shield, they will call you ‘Himof the Rueful Countenance’ and believe me I am telling you the truth,for I assure you, señor (and in good part be it said), hunger and theloss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, asI say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.”Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved tocall himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as hehad devised.Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litterwere bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:“Señor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourselfthan any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten androuted, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beatenthem, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come insearch of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, themountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to dobut make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the graveand the living to the loaf.”And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and afterproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselvesin a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloadedhis beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfyingtheir appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the deadman’s clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece ofill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that wasthat they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow wherethey were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told inthe following chapter.CHAPTER XX.OF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THEVALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVEDBY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLDc19a.jpg (147K)Full Size“It cannot be, señor, but that this grass is a proof that there must behard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be wellto move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we mayquench this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt ismore distressing than hunger.”The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by thebridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away uponhim the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling theirway, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, asif falling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered themgreatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it camethey heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfactionthe sound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was bynature timid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling witha measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that,together with the furious din of the water, would have struck terrorinto any heart but Don Quixote’s. The night was, as has been said,dark, and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees,whose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; sothat, what with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of thewater, and the rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe anddread; more especially as they perceived that the strokes did notcease, nor the wind lull, nor morning approach; to all which might beadded their ignorance as to where they were.c19b.jpg (204K)Full SizeBut Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante,and bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, andsaid, “Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven’s will have been born inthis our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as itis called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiantdeeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knightsof the Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and hewho is to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantesand Tirantes, the Phœbuses and Belianises, with the whole herd offamous knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which Ilive such exploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure theirbrightest deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, thegloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur ofthose trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came,that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down fromthe lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering thatwounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itselfare enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Marshimself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of thekind. Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentiveand stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom througheagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be;therefore tighten Rocinante’s girths a little, and God be with thee;wait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come notback, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favourand a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to myincomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath died inattempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers.”When Sancho heard his master’s words he began to weep in the mostpathetic way, saying:“Señor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadfuladventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turnabout and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don’t drink forthree days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less willthere be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a timeheard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preachthat he who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to temptGod by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escapesave by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for yourworship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringingyou out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies thatwere with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften thathard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will havehardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul upto anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to comeand serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but ascovetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just asI had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island yourworship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of ityou mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God’ssake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship willnot entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off tillmorning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells meit cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Hornis overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.”“How canst thou see, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “where it makes thatline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, whenthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the wholeheaven?”“That’s true,” said Sancho, “but fear has sharp eyes, and sees thingsunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reasonto show that it now wants but little of day.”“Let it want what it may,” replied Don Quixote, “it shall not be saidof me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside fromdoing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,Sancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart toundertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take careto watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do isto tighten Rocinante’s girths well, and wait here, for I shall comeback shortly, alive or dead.”Sancho perceiving it his master’s final resolve, and how little histears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to haverecourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait tilldaylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietlyand without being felt, with his ass’ halter tied both Rocinante’slegs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horsecould only move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panzasaid:“See there, señor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has soordered it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate,and spur and strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, asthey say, against the pricks.”Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heelsinto the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicionof the tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak oruntil Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came ofsomething other than Sancho’s ingenuity. So he said to him, “As it isso, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait tilldawn smiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming.”“There is no need to weep,” answered Sancho, “for I will amuse yourworship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed youlike to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grassafter the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comesand the moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure youare looking forward to.”“What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?” said DonQuixote. “Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take theirrest in the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or doas thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with mycharacter.”“Be not angry, master mine,” replied Sancho, “I did not mean to saythat;” and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of thesaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master’s leftthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger’s width from him;so much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with aregular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as hehad proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread ofwhat he heard would let him; “Still,” said he, “I will strive to tell astory which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes withthe telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me yourattention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is tocome be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it—yourworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to theirtales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of CatoZonzorino the Roman, that says ‘the evil for him that goes to look forit,’ and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to showthat your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in anyquarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobodyforces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.”“Go on with thy story, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and leave the choiceof our road to my care.”“I say then,” continued Sancho, “that in a village of Estremadura therewas a goat-shepherd—that is to say, one who tended goats—which shepherdor goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruizwas in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdesscalled Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this richgrazier—”“If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done thesetwo days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, orelse say nothing.”“Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am tellingthis,” answered Sancho, “and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is itright of your worship to ask me to make new customs.”“Tell it as thou wilt,” replied Don Quixote; “and as fate will have itthat I cannot help listening to thee, go on.”“And so, lord of my soul,” continued Sancho, as I have said, thisshepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wildbuxom lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she hadlittle moustaches; I fancy I see her now.”“Then you knew her?” said Don Quixote.“I did not know her,” said Sancho, “but he who told me the story saidit was so true and certain that when I told it to another I mightsafely declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course oftime, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion,contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned intohatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, wassome little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line andtrespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate herfrom that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determinedto quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again.Torralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediatelysmitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before.”“That is the natural way of women,” said Don Quixote, “to scorn the onethat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.”“It came to pass,” said Sancho, “that the shepherd carried out hisintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across theplains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.Torralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefootfollowed him at a distance, with a pilgrim’s staff in her hand and ascrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit oflooking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other ofpaint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going totrouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say,came with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at thattime swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he cameto there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or hisflock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceivedthat Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance withher tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closelythat he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so smallthat it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that hespoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundredgoats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goatover; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, andagain brought over another—let your worship keep count of the goats thefisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will bean end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word ofit. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side wasmiry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in goingand coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, andanother.”“Take it for granted he brought them all across,” said Don Quixote,“and don’t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make anend of bringing them over this twelvemonth.”“How many have gone across so far?” said Sancho.“How the devil do I know?” replied Don Quixote.“There it is,” said Sancho, “what I told you, that you must keep a goodcount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is nogoing any farther.”“How can that be?” said Don Quixote; “is it so essential to the storyto know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there bea mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?”“No, señor, not a bit,” replied Sancho; “for when I asked your worshipto tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did notknow, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of mymemory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.”“So, then,” said Don Quixote, “the story has come to an end?”“As much as my mother has,” said Sancho.“In truth,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast told one of the rareststories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could haveimagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen norwill be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thyexcellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps thoseceaseless strokes may have confused thy wits.”“All that may be,” replied Sancho, “but I know that as to my story, allthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the countof the passage of the goats begins.”“Let it end where it will, well and good,” said Don Quixote, “and letus see if Rocinante can go;” and again he spurred him, and againRocinante made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was nowapproaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or thatit was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to dowhat no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that hadpenetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master byas much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was,however, also impossible; so what he did for peace’s sake was to removehis right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untiegently and silently the running string which alone held up hisbreeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feetlike fetters; he then raised his shirt as well as he could and baredhis hind quarters, no slim ones. But, this accomplished, which hefancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait andembarrassment, another still greater difficulty presented itself, forit seemed to him impossible to relieve himself without making somenoise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders together,holding his breath as much as he could; but in spite of his precautionshe was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very differentfrom that which was causing him so much fear.c19c.jpg (308K)Full SizeDon Quixote, hearing it, said, “What noise is that, Sancho?”“I don’t know, señor,” said he; “it must be something new, foradventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle.” Once more hetried his luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noiseor disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had givenhim so much discomfort. But as Don Quixote’s sense of smell was asacute as his hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him thatthe fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that someshould reach his nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief bycompressing it between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone,“Sancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear.”“I am,” answered Sancho; “but how does your worship perceive it nowmore than ever?”“Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not ofambergris,” answered Don Quixote.“Very likely,” said Sancho, “but that’s not my fault, but yourworship’s, for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at suchunwonted paces.”“Then go back three or four, my friend,” said Don Quixote, all the timewith his fingers to his nose; “and for the future pay more attention tothy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my greatfamiliarity with thee that has bred this contempt.”“I’ll bet,” replied Sancho, “that your worship thinks I have donesomething I ought not with my person.”“It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,” returned Don Quixote.With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed thenight, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, verycautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon asRocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at allmettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing—for as tocapering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote,then, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and asignal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this time day hadfully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw thathe was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade;he perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, butcould not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay helet Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, hetold him to wait for him there three days at most, as he had saidbefore, and if he should not have returned by that time, he might feelsure it had been God’s will that he should end his days in thatperilous adventure. He again repeated the message and commission withwhich he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he wasnot to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before leavinghome he had made his will, in which he would find himself fullyrecompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he hadserved; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of thatdanger, he might look upon the promised island as much more thancertain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affectingwords of his good master, and resolved to stay with him until the finalissue and end of the business. From these tears and this honourableresolve of Sancho Panza’s the author of this history infers that hemust have been of good birth and at least an old Christian; and thefeeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him showany weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well as he could,he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water andof the strokes seemed to come.Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,his ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancingsome distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a littlemeadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush ofwater flung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudelyconstructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from amongwhich came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which stillcontinued without intermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise ofthe water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced stepby step towards the houses, commending himself with all his heart tohis lady, imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise, andon the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sanchowho never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could andpeered between the legs of Rocinante to see if he could now discoverwhat it was that caused him such fear and apprehension. They went itmight be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the truecause, beyond the possibility of any mistake, of that dread-soundingand to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night insuch fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was (if,reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fulling hammerswhich by their alternate strokes made all the din.When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigidfrom head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bentdown upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glancedat Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full oflaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of hisvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and whenSancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to holdhis sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.Four times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break outafresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grewfurious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, “Thou must know,friend Sancho, that of Heaven’s will I was born in this our iron age torevive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reservedperils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;” and here he went onrepeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heardthe awful strokes.Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him twosuch blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he hadcaught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unlessindeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkwardreturn in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry itstill further, said to him very humbly, “Calm yourself, sir, for by GodI am only joking.”“Well, then, if you are joking I am not,” replied Don Quixote. “Lookhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown thecourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds andtell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, whenperhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turnme these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, oneby one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,then make what mockery you like of me.”“No more of that, señor,” returned Sancho; “I own I went a little toofar with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is madebetween us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that maybefall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the greatfear we were in?—at least that I was in; for as to your worship I seenow that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismayis.”“I do not deny,” said Don Quixote, “that what happened to us may beworth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it isnot everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.”“At any rate,” said Sancho, “your worship knew how to hit the rightpoint with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on theshoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But letthat pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say ‘heloves thee well that makes thee weep;’ and moreover that it is the waywith great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him apair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,unless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdomson the mainland.”“It may be on the dice,” said Don Quixote, “that all thou sayest willcome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know thatour first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for thefuture bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in mycompany; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and theyare innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to hislord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great faultof thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect forme; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There wasGandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the InsulaFirme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with hiscap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, moreturquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire ofGalaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatnessof his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in thewhole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have saidthou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference betweenmaster and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: sothat from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe morerespect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provokedwith you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits thatI have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not yourwages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.”“All that your worship says is very well,” said Sancho, “but I shouldlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it mightbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of aknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or bythe day like bricklayers?”“I do not believe,” replied Don Quixote, “that such squires were everon wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentionedthine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view towhat may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out inthese wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer fortrifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that inthis there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.”“That is true,” said Sancho, “since the mere noise of the hammers of afulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valianterrant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not openmy lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship’s, butonly to honour you as my master and natural lord.”“By so doing,” replied Don Quixote, “shalt thou live long on the faceof the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected asthough they were parents.”c19e.jpg (33K)CHAPTER XXI.WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO’SHELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLEKNIGHTc20a.jpg (73K)Full SizeIt now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into thefulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them onaccount of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account;so turning aside to right they came upon another road, different fromthat which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards DonQuixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head somethingthat shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho andsaid:“I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all beingmaxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences,especially that one that says, ‘Where one door shuts, another opens.’ Isay so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure wewere looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it nowopens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure,and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and Icannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of thenight. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us onewho wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I tookthe oath thou rememberest.”“Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,” saidSancho, “for I don’t want any more fulling mills to finish off fullingand knocking our senses out.”“The devil take thee, man,” said Don Quixote; “what has a helmet to dowith fulling mills?”“I don’t know,” replied Sancho, “but, faith, if I might speak as Iused, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see youwere mistaken in what you say.”“How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?” returnedDon Quixote; “tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards uson a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?”“What I see and make out,” answered Sancho, “is only a man on a greyass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.”“Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,” said Don Quixote; “stand to oneside and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying aword, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue andpossess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.”“I will take care to stand aside,” said Sancho; “but God grant, I sayonce more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.”“I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fullingmills to me again,” said Don Quixote, “or I vow—and I say no more—I’llfull the soul out of you.”Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vowhe had hurled like a bowl at him.The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight thatDon Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were twovillages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary’s shopnor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber ofthe larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man whorequired to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and onthis errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; butas luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and notto spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on hishead, and being clean it glittered at half a league’s distance. He rodeupon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to DonQuixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; foreverything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry andill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, withoutentering into any parley with him, at Rocinante’s top speed he boredown upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run himthrough and through, and as he reached him, without checking the furyof his charge, he cried to him:“Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord thatwhich is so reasonably my due.”The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw thisapparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himselffrom the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; andno sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly thana deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contentedhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitatedthe beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cutsoff with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows itis pursued.He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his handssaid:“By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it isworth a maravedis,” and handed it to his master, who immediately put iton his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search offitment, and not finding it he said, “Clearly the pagan to whosemeasure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a verylarge head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting.”When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable torestrain his laughter, but remembering his master’s wrath he checkedhimself in the midst of it.“What art thou laughing at, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.“I am laughing,” said he, “to think of the great head the pagan musthave had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regularbarber’s basin.”“Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?” said Don Quixote; “that thiswonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accidenthave come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise orrealise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it tobe of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake ofwhat it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like abarber’s basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recogniseit, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rightsat the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such stylethat that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battlesshall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I willwear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all themore as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of astone.”“That is,” said Sancho, “if it is not shot with a sling as they were inthe battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on yourworship’s grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught thatmade me vomit my bowels up.”“It does not grieve me much to have lost it,” said Don Quixote, “forthou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.”“So have I,” answered Sancho, “but if ever I make it, or try it againas long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have nointention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, withall my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from woundinganyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard toprevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for itbut to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes,and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us.”“Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,” said Don Quixote on hearing this,“for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: butknow that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attachimportance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what brokenrib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jestand sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in thatlight I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging theethan the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now,or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not beso famous for her beauty as she is;” and here he heaved a sigh and sentit aloft; and said Sancho, “Let it pass for a jest as it cannot berevenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was,and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than offmy shoulders. But putting that aside, will your worship tell me whatare we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass,which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here?for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likelyever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one.”“I have never been in the habit,” said Don Quixote, “of taking spoil ofthose whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take awaytheir horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that thevictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful totake that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.”“God knows I should like to take it,” returned Sancho, “or at least tochange it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verilythe laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to letone ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might atleast change trappings.”“On that head I am not quite certain,” answered Don Quixote, “and thematter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayestchange them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.”“So urgent is it,” answered Sancho, “that if they were for my ownperson I could not want them more;” and forthwith, fortified by thislicence, he effected the _mutatio capparum_, and rigged out his beastto the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done,they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plunderedfrom the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from thefulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in suchloathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and,all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixedroad (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for trueknights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante’s will, whichcarried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at aventure without any other aim.As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master,“Señor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? Forsince you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several thingshave gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip ofmy tongue that I don’t want to be spoiled.”“Say, on, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and be brief in thy discourse,for there is no pleasure in one that is long.”“Well then, señor,” returned Sancho, “I say that for some days past Ihave been considering how little is got or gained by going in search ofthese adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds andcross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriouslyachieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must beleft untold for ever, to the loss of your worship’s object and thecredit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better(saving your worship’s better judgment) if we were to go and serve someemperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whoseservice your worship may prove the worth of your person, your greatmight, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whoseservice we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according tohis merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someone to set downyour achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever.Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits,though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry towrite the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.”“Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “but beforethat point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were onprobation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, nameand fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to thecourt of some great monarch the knight may be already known by hisdeeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate ofthe city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, ‘This is theKnight of the Sun’—or the Serpent, or any other title under which hemay have achieved great deeds. ‘This,’ they will say, ‘is he whovanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength;he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the longenchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.’ Sofrom one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; andpresently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of thatkingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon ashe beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device onhis shield, he will as a matter of course say, ‘What ho! Forth all ye,the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who comethhither!’ At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, andsalute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to thequeen’s chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess herdaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplisheddamsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in theknown world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix hereyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to theother something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or whythey will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, andsorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making theirpains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, nodoubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, havingremoved his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarletwherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he willlook still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with theking, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyesoff her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and shewill do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, adamsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly throughthe door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarffollowed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certainadventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve itshall be deemed the best knight in the world.“The king will then command all those present to essay it, and nonewill bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to thegreat enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyedand will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placedher thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince,or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another aspowerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been somedays at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in thesaid war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight willcourteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that nighthe will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of thechamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which hehas already many times conversed with her, the go-between andconfidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, muchdistressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her ladyhe would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will cometo herself and will present her white hands through the grating to theknight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathingthem with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are toinform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess willentreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he willpromise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takeshis leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakeshim thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep forsorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave ofthe king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair,it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive avisit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heartis pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. Theconfidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, wholistens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is notknowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not;the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantryof bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one whowas royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and shestrives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in herparents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhilethe knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers theking’s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns tothe court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreedthat he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward ofhis services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who heis, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way itmay be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes toregard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight isproved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know notwhat, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies,the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. Andhere comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and allwho have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries hissquire to a damsel of the princess’s, who will be, no doubt, the onewho was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very greatduke.”“That’s what I want, and no mistake about it!” said Sancho. “That’swhat I’m waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for yourworship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”“Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “for in thesame manner, and by the same steps as I have described here,knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all wewant now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war andhas a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think ofthat, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quartersbefore repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that iswanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautifuldaughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or evensecond cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to giveme his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied onthis point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that bythis deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. Trueit is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, andentitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sagewho shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigreethat I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for Iwould have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages inthe world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kingsand princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in apoint like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the commonherd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,and the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of suchthat after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, withwhich the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;and should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though shewell knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for herlord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes toseizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death willput an end to the wrath of her parents.”“It comes to this, too,” said Sancho, “what some naughty people say,‘Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;’ though it wouldfit better to say, ‘A clear escape is better than good men’s prayers.’I say so because if my lord the king, your worship’s father-in-law,will not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothingfor it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. Butthe mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peacefulenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far asrewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be hiswife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his badluck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.”“Nobody can object to that,” said Don Quixote.“Then since that may be,” said Sancho, “there is nothing for it but tocommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.”“God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,” said Don Quixote,“and mean be he who thinks himself mean.”“In God’s name let him be so,” said Sancho: “I am an old Christian, andto fit me for a count that’s enough.”“And more than enough for thee,” said Don Quixote; “and even wert thounot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easilygive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, forwhen I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and theymay say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee‘your lordship,’ whether they like it or not.”“Not a doubt of it; and I’ll know how to support the tittle,” saidSancho.“Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,” said his master.“So be it,” answered Sancho. “I say I will know how to behave, for oncein my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle’s gown sat sowell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the samebrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke’s robe on myback, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believethey’ll come a hundred leagues to see me.”“Thou wilt look well,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must shave thy beardoften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thoudost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thouart at the distance of a musket shot.”“What more will it be,” said Sancho, “than having a barber, and keepinghim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make himgo behind me like a nobleman’s equerry.”“Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?”asked Don Quixote.“I will tell you,” answered Sancho. “Years ago I was for a month at thecapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who theysaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback inevery turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this mandid not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; theyanswered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom withnobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,for I have never forgotten it.”“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and in the same way thou mayestcarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use alltogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be thefirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one’sbeard is a greater trust than saddling one’s horse.”“Let the barber business be my look-out,” said Sancho; “and yourworship’s be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.”“So it shall be,” answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he sawwhat will be told in the following chapter.c20e.jpg (18K)CHAPTER XXII.OF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHOAGAINST THEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GOc22a.jpg (178K)Full SizeCid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in thismost grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original historythat after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Manchaand his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chaptertwenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the roadhe was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck,like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on theirhands. With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot;those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelinsand swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:“That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by forceof the king’s orders.”“How by force?” asked Don Quixote; “is it possible that the king usesforce against anyone?”“I do not say that,” answered Sancho, “but that these are peoplecondemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king’s galleys.”“In fact,” replied Don Quixote, “however it may be, these people aregoing where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.”“Just so,” said Sancho.“Then if so,” said Don Quixote, “here is a case for the exercise of myoffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.”“Recollect, your worship,” said Sancho, “Justice, which is the kinghimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, butpunishing them for their crimes.”The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote invery courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to begood enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they wereconducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horsebackanswered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, thatthey were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be saidand all he had any business to know.c22b.jpg (298K)Full Size“Nevertheless,” replied Don Quixote, “I should like to know from eachof them separately the reason of his misfortune;” to this he added moreto the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civillythat the other mounted guard said to him:“Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence ofevery one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or readthem; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and theywill, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking aboutrascalities.”With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had theynot granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for whatoffences he was now in such a sorry case.He made answer that it was for being a lover.“For that only?” replied Don Quixote; “why, if for being lovers theysend people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.”“The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,” said the galleyslave; “mine was that I loved a washerwoman’s basket of clean linen sowell, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the lawhad not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own willto this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion fortorture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes onthe back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end ofit.”“What are gurapas?” asked Don Quixote.“Gurapas are galleys,” answered the galley slave, who was a young manof about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply,so downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, andsaid, “He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.”“What!” said Don Quixote, “for being musicians and singers are peoplesent to the galleys too?”“Yes, sir,” answered the galley slave, “for there is nothing worse thansinging under suffering.”“On the contrary, I have heard say,” said Don Quixote, “that he whosings scares away his woes.”“Here it is the reverse,” said the galley slave; “for he who sings onceweeps all his life.”“I do not understand it,” said Don Quixote; but one of the guards saidto him, “Sir, to sing under suffering means with the _non sancta_fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to thetorture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that isa cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six yearsin the galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had onthe back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the otherthieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub,and jeer, and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enoughto say nay; for, say they, ‘nay’ has no more letters in it than ‘yea,’and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on hisown tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinkingthey are not very far out.”“And I think so too,” answered Don Quixote; then passing on to thethird he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answeredvery readily and unconcernedly, “I am going for five years to theirladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats.”“I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,” saidDon Quixote.“That,” said the galley slave, “is like a man having money at sea whenhe is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say sobecause if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that yourworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary’s pen andfreshened up the attorney’s wit with them, so that to-day I should bein the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on thisroad coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience—there, that’senough of it.”Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with awhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked thereason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, butthe fifth acted as his tongue and said, “This worthy man is going tothe galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremonyand on horseback.”“That means,” said Sancho Panza, “as I take it, to have been exposed toshame in public.”“Just so,” replied the galley slave, “and the offence for which theygave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, naybody-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, andfor having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.”“If that touch had not been thrown in,” said Don Quixote, “he would notdeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to commandand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in awell-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in otheroffices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in thisway many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this officeand calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such aswomen more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing andexperience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity ofcontrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to theirmouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to gofarther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose thosewho are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is notthe fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someoneable to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additionalfact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to seethese white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful aposition on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there areno sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as somesimple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charmthat can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is toturn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have powerto cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel thewill.”“It is true,” said the good old man, “and indeed, sir, as far as thecharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp Icannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for myonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live inpeace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentionswere unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come backfrom, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment thatnever gives me a moment’s ease;” and again he fell to weeping asbefore, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out areal of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the mananswered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the lastone.“I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousinsof mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; inshort, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such acomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:it was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I wasnear having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for sixyears, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am ayoung man; let life only last, and with that all will come right. Ifyou, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay itto you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions tohim to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may beas long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.”This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said hewas a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards theother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg achain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings onhis neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a“keep-friend” or “friend’s foot,” from which hung two irons reaching tohis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands weresecured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands tohis mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why thisman carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied thatit was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest puttogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though theymarched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were indread of his making his escape.“What crimes can he have committed,” said Don Quixote, “if they havenot deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?”“He goes for ten years,” replied the guard, “which is the same thing ascivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is thefamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.”“Gently, señor commissary,” said the galley slave at this, “let us haveno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and myfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mindhis own business, and he will be doing enough.”“Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,” repliedthe commissary, “if you don’t want me to make you hold your tongue inspite of your teeth.”“It is easy to see,” returned the galley slave, “that man goes as Godpleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillode Parapilla or not.”“Don’t they call you so, you liar?” said the guard.“They do,” returned Gines, “but I will make them give over calling meso, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you,sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speedyou, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness aboutthe lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you Iam Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.”“He says true,” said the commissary, “for he has himself written hisstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison inpawn for two hundred reals.”“And I mean to take it out of pawn,” said Gines, “though it were in fortwo hundred ducats.”“Is it so good?” said Don Quixote.“So good is it,” replied Gines, “that a fig for ‘Lazarillo de Tormes,’and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be writtencompared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts,and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.”“And how is the book entitled?” asked Don Quixote.“The ‘Life of Gines de Pasamonte,’” replied the subject of it.“And is it finished?” asked Don Quixote.“How can it be finished,” said the other, “when my life is not yetfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point whenthey sent me to the galleys this last time.”“Then you have been there before?” said Don Quixote.“In the service of God and the king I have been there for four yearsbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash arelike,” replied Gines; “and it is no great grievance to me to go back tothem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still manythings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more thanenough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, forI have it by heart.”“You seem a clever fellow,” said Don Quixote.“And an unfortunate one,” replied Gines, “for misfortune alwayspersecutes good wit.”“It persecutes rogues,” said the commissary.“I told you already to go gently, master commissary,” said Pasamonte;“their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat uswretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;if not, by the life of—never mind—; it may be that some day the stainsmade in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold histongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, forwe have had quite enough of this entertainment.”The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for histhreats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not toill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tiedto have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain ofthem he said:“From all you have told me, dear brethren, I make out clearly thatthough they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you areabout to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to themvery much against the grain and against your will, and that perhapsthis one’s want of courage under torture, that one’s want of money, theother’s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of thejudge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure toobtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself nowto my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstratein your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world andcaused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which Ibelong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need andunder the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark ofprudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will askthese gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to releaseyou and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others toserve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to mea hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free.Moreover, sirs of the guard,” added Don Quixote, “these poor fellowshave done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder;there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked orreward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be theinstruments of punishment to others, they being therein no wayconcerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if youcomply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you willnot voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my armshall compel you to comply with it by force.”“Nice nonsense!” said the commissary; “a fine piece of pleasantry hehas come out with at last! He wants us to let the king’s prisoners go,as if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so!Go your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight thatyou’ve got on your head, and don’t go looking for three feet on a cat.”“’Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,” replied Don Quixote, andacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving himtime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded witha lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that hadthe musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at thisunexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horsebackseized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked DonQuixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt itwould have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chancebefore them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contrivingto break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breakingloose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothingat all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand torelease Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon theplain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one andlevelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every oneof the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escapePasamonte’s musket, as the showers of stones the now released galleyslaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at theaffair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report thematter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bellwould at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so tohis master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go intohiding in the sierra that was close by.“That is all very well,” said Don Quixote, “but I know what must bedone now;” and calling together all the galley slaves, who were nowrunning riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collectedthem round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them asfollows: “To be grateful for benefits received is the part of personsof good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God isingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifestproof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I havetaken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of ElToboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea delToboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance,sends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in fulldetail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to therecovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where yewill, and good fortune attend you.”Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, “That which you, sir,our deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the mostimpossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along theroads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way,endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape theHoly Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. Whatyour worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service andtribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantityof ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship’sintention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by nightas by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine thatwe are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to takeup our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is nownight, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of usis like asking pears of the elm tree.”“Then by all that’s good,” said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath),“Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your nameis, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between yourlegs and the whole chain on your back.”Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughlyconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he hadcommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused inthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back theybegan to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quiteunable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no moreheeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho plantedhimself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from thehailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shieldhimself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck himfull on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched thebasin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on hisshoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost topieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over hisarmour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaveshad not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him inhis shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoilsof the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous aboutkeeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than aboutburdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselvesbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho andDon Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass withdrooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if hethought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over;Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought tothe ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of theHoly Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served bythe very persons for whom he had done so much.c22e.jpg (44K)CHAPTER XXIII.OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THERAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORYc23a.jpg (148K)Full SizeSeeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, “Ihave always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throwwater into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoidedthis trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and takewarning for the future.”c23b.jpg (318K)Full Size“Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,” returnedSancho; “but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if youhad believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will beavoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the HolyBrotherhood, and they don’t care two maravedis for all theknights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear theirarrows whistling past my ears this minute.”“Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but lest thoushouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise,this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of thatfury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, inlife or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrewfrom this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thyentreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, andfrom this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and saythou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; andanswer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing orretiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carrysome little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand hereand await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread,but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the SevenMaccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoodsin the world.”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “to retire is not to flee, and there is nowisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part ofwise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk allin one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I havegot some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of havingtaken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will helpyou; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need oflegs than hands just now.”Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way onhis ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was closeby, as it was Sancho’s design to cross it entirely and come out againat El Viso or Almodóvar del Campo, and hide for some days among itscrags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come tolook for them. He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stockof provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with thegalley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing howthey pillaged and ransacked.c23c.jpg (297K)Full SizeThat night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where itseemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at leastas many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encampedbetween two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which,according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the truefaith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, soordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who bythe virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain,driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason todread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fearled him to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had beenled by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to fallasleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads toevildoing, and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of thefuture, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made uphis mind to steal Sancho Panza’s ass, not troubling himself aboutRocinante, as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell.While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day dawned he was farout of reach.c23d.jpg (256K)Full SizeAurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadnessto Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeinghimself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament inthe world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heardhim saying, “O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children’splaything, my wife’s joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of myburdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with thesix-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half mycharges.”Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoledSancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out offive ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho tookcomfort at this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returnedthanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part wasrejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to himto be just the place for the adventures he was in quest of. Theybrought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had befallenknights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went alongreflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them thathe had no thought for anything else.c23e.jpg (280K)Full SizeNor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling ina safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as wereleft of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master ladenwith what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing hispaunch, and so long as he could go that way, he would not have given afarthing to meet with another adventure.While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky objectthat lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help himif it were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pikehe was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half orrather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho hadto help to take them up, and his master directed him to see what thevalise contained. Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though thevalise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rottencondition he was able to see its contents, which were four shirts offine holland, and other articles of linen no less curious than clean;and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soonas he saw them he exclaimed:“Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good forsomething!”Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; thisDon Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it forhimself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valiseof its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Consideringthe whole matter, Don Quixote observed:“It seems to me, Sancho—and it is impossible it can be otherwise—thatsome strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attackedand slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to buryhim.”“That cannot be,” answered Sancho, “because if they had been robbersthey would not have left this money.”“Thou art right,” said Don Quixote, “and I cannot guess or explain whatthis may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there isanything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover whatwe want to know.”He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly butin a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sanchomight hear it, he found that it ran as follows:SONNETOr Love is lacking in intelligence,Or to the height of cruelty attains,Or else it is my doom to suffer painsBeyond the measure due to my offence.But if Love be a God, it follows thenceThat he knows all, and certain it remainsNo God loves cruelty; then who ordainsThis penance that enthrals while it torments?It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;Such evil with such goodness cannot live;And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,I only know it is my fate to die.To him who knows not whence his maladyA miracle alone a cure can give.c23f.jpg (344K)Full Size“There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,” said Sancho, “unlessby that clue there’s in it, one may draw out the ball of the wholematter.”“What clue is there?” said Don Quixote.“I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,” said Sancho.“I only said Chloe,” replied Don Quixote; “and that no doubt, is thename of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and,faith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.”“Then your worship understands rhyming too?”“And better than thou thinkest,” replied Don Quixote, “as thou shaltsee when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to endto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho,that all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were greattroubadours and great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, ormore properly speaking gifts, are the peculiar property oflovers-errant: true it is that the verses of the knights of old havemore spirit than neatness in them.”“Read more, your worship,” said Sancho, “and you will find somethingthat will enlighten us.”Don Quixote turned the page and said, “This is prose and seems to be aletter.”“A correspondence letter, señor?”“From the beginning it seems to be a love letter,” replied Don Quixote.“Then let your worship read it aloud,” said Sancho, “for I am very fondof love matters.”“With all my heart,” said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sanchohad requested him, he found it ran thus:Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence thenews of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but notmore worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envythe fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thybeauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to bean angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hastsent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be everhidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and Ireap not a revenge I would not have.When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, “There is less to begathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it issome rejected lover;” and turning over nearly all the pages of the bookhe found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, whileothers he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, somerapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sanchoexamined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in thepad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he didnot rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anythingshould escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousnessexcited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near ahundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanketflights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers’ fisticuffs,missing alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, andweariness he had endured in the service of his good master, cheap atthe price; as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for allby the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove.The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find outwho the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet andletter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts,that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty ofhis lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in thatuninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom hecould inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, takingwhatever road Rocinante chose—which was where he could make hisway—firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meetsome rare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with thesethoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before theireyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock totussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he wasunclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs andfeet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvetbut so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.c23g.jpg (360K)Full SizeHe was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which hepassed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenanceobserved and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt,he was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feeblenessof Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover,slow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to theconclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise,and made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should haveto wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so hedirected Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain,while he himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means theymight light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight.“I could not do that,” said Sancho, “for when I separate from yourworship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts ofpanics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from thistime forth I am not going to stir a finger’s width from your presence.”“It shall be so,” said he of the Rueful Countenance, “and I am veryglad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never failthee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behindme slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; letus make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this manthat we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.”To which Sancho made answer, “Far better would it be not to look forhim, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money,it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, thatwithout taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of ituntil in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real ownermay be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it,and then the king will hold me harmless.”“Thou art wrong there, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for now that we havea suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we arebound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, thestrong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guiltyas if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for himgive thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.”And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him onfoot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of themountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogsand pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which stillfurther strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the ownerof the mule and the saddle-pad.c23h.jpg (381K)Full SizeAs they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of ashepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeareda great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountainthe goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixotecalled aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. Heshouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom ornever trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and otherwild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down,and they would explain all to him.The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,he said, “I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies deadin the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these sixmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?”“We have come upon nobody,” answered Don Quixote, “nor on anythingexcept a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far fromthis.”“I found it too,” said the goatherd, “but I would not lift it nor gonear it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for thedevil is crafty, and things rise up under one’s feet to make one fallwithout knowing why or wherefore.”“That’s exactly what I say,” said Sancho; “I found it too, and I wouldnot go within a stone’s throw of it; there I left it, and there it liesjust as it was, for I don’t want a dog with a bell.”“Tell me, good man,” said Don Quixote, “do you know who is the owner ofthis property?”“All I can tell you,” said the goatherd, “is that about six months ago,more or less, there arrived at a shepherd’s hut three leagues, perhaps,away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted onthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad andvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what partof this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it waswhere we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half aleague farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; andI am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no roador path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing ouranswer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out tohim, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at hisquestion and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction ofthe sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some daysafterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and withoutsaying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs andkicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all thebread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back againinto the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherdslearned this we went in search of him for about two days through themost remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found himlodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet uswith great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face sodisfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him butthat his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection wehad of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted uscourteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder atseeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him inorder that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had beenimposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were neverable to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want offood, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should findhim, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; orif this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us andnot take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to askit in God’s name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixedabode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherevernight might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weepingso bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had wenot joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time withwhat we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of goodbirth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened tohim, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make itplain.“But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which westood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of thisabstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, nowstaring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without movingan eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising hiseyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kindhad come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined wasthe truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrownhimself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage andfierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beatenor bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, ‘Oh faithlessFernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hastdone me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode anddwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and tothese he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando andcharging him with treachery and faithlessness.“We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, andwithout another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among thesebrakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;from this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, andthat someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievousnature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed toshow. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, andthey have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time tobeg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at anotherto take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness uponhim, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept itbut snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in hissenses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, andreceives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you thetruth, sirs,” continued the goatherd, “it was yesterday that weresolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and theother two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, tothe town of Almodóvar, which is eight leagues from this, and therestrive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learnwhen he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom wemay give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say inanswer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of thearticles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness andso naked.”For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man gobounding along the mountainside, and he was now filled with amazementat what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever todiscover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, ashe had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, notleaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chancearranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that verymoment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, theyouth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking tohimself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, muchmore at a distance. His garb was what has been described, save that ashe drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which hewore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore suchgarments could not be of very low rank.Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voicebut with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equalpoliteness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bredbearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close inhis arms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we maycall the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of theRueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and,placing his hands on Don Quixote’s shoulders, stood gazing at him as ifseeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at thesight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixotewas at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak afterembracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on.c23i.jpg (53K)Full SizeCHAPTER XXIV.IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENAc24a.jpg (151K)Full SizeThe history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixotelistened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:“Of a surety, señor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank youfor the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would Iwere in a condition to requite with something more than good-will thatwhich you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you havegiven me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returningkindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them.”“Mine,” replied Don Quixote, “is to be of service to you, so much sothat I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you,and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found forthat sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem tolabour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if searchhad been necessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one ofthose that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was mypurpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as Icould; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who canfeel for it. And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged withany kind of courtesy, I entreat you, señor, by that which I perceiveyou possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whateveryou love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and thecause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like abrute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to yourcondition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,” added DonQuixote, “by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by myvocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you withall the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving yourmisfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it asI promised to do.”The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talkin this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again,and again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughlyexamined him, he said to him:“If you have anything to give me to eat, for God’s sake give it me, andafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of thegoodwill you have displayed towards me.”Sancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished theRagged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gavehim he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no timebetween mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ateneither he nor they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he haddone he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he ledthem to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner ofa rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and theothers did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One,settling himself in his place, said:“If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words thesurpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break thethread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for theinstant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.”These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale hissquire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that hadcrossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return tothe Ragged One, he went on to say:“I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the storyof my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to addfresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an endof the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything ofimportance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.”Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with thisassurance he began as follows:“My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of thisAndalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so greatthat my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it withoutbeing able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune cando little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same countrythere was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I coulddesire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as richas I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to soworthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adoredfrom my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all theinnocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of ourfeelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearlythat as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, athing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our familiesand wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us,so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety’s sake torefuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps imitating the parentsof that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but addedlove to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence uponour tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can makeknown the heart’s secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; formany a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest willand strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many letters did Iwrite her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how manyditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared andmade known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in itsrecollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatientand feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved toput into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode ofwinning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for mylawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me forthe disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself ashonoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father wasalive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not inaccordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to betaken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflectingthat there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assentto it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the verysame instant to let him know what my desires were. When I entered theroom where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which,before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, ‘By this letter thouwilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to servethee.’ This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is agrandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. Itook and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering thateven I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply withthe request the duke made in it, which was that he would send meimmediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion, notservant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge ofplacing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he heldme. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when Iheard my father say, ‘Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, inaccordance with the duke’s wish, and give thanks to God who is openinga road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dostdeserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. Thetime for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I toldher all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating himto allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until Ishould see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise,and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, Ipresented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him sokindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servantsgrowing envious of me, and regarding the duke’s inclination to show mefavour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gavethe greatest pleasure was the duke’s second son, Fernando by name, agallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who verysoon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody;for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he didnot carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as DonFernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends no secretremains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando hadgrown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to me, and inparticular a love affair which troubled his mind a little. He wasdeeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father’s, thedaughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest,discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide inwhich of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled.The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernandoto such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome hervirtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her to becomeher husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt animpossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by thebest arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of torestrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I producedno effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquaintedwith the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd,foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a goodservant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed tothe honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, hetold me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind thebeauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months,and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us,to my father’s house under the pretence, which he would make to theduke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in mycity, which produces the best in the world. When I heard him say so,even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailedit as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by myaffection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offeredme of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish Icommended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put itinto execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence producedits effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, asafterwards appeared, when he said this to me he had already enjoyed thepeasant girl under the title of husband, and was waiting for anopportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dreadof what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly.It happened, then, that as with young men love is for the most partnothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is enjoyment,comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be love takesto flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature, which fixes nolimit to true love—what I mean is that after Don Fernando had enjoyedthis peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled, and ifat first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love,he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise.“The duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; wearrived at my city, and my father gave him the reception due to hisrank; I saw Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead ordeadened, my love gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story ofit to Don Fernando, for I thought that in virtue of the greatfriendship he bore me I was bound to conceal nothing from him. Iextolled her beauty, her gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praisesexcited in him a desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions. Tomy misfortune I yielded to it, showing her to him one night by thelight of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another. Asshe appeared to him in her dressing-gown, she drove all the beauties hehad seen until then out of his recollection; speech failed him, hishead turned, he was spell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as youwill see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and to inflamestill further his passion, which he hid from me and revealed to Heavenalone, it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreatingme to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate, so modest, andso tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone werecombined all the charms of beauty and understanding that weredistributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and Iown it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had topraise Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from hismouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him,for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, andhe would start the subject himself even though he dragged it inunseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount ofjealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith ofLuscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured meagainst. Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent toLuscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed thewit and sense of both. It so happened, then, that Luscinda havingbegged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of,Amadis of Gaul—”Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:“Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the LadyLuscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would havebeen requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding,for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a tastefor such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned,you need waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, andintelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare herto be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world;and I wish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her theworthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatlyrelish Daraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherdDarinel, and the admirable verses of his bucolics, sung and deliveredby him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come whenthis omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is neededthan for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village,for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are thedelight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;—though it occursto me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the spite ofwicked and envious enchanters;—but pardon me for having broken thepromise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hearchivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking aboutthem than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of themoon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more tothe purpose now.”While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fallupon his breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twiceDon Quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up noruttered a word in reply; but after some time he raised his head andsaid, “I cannot get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the worldremove it, or make me think otherwise—and he would be a blockhead whowould hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave MasterElisabad made free with Queen Madasima.”“That is not true, by all that’s good,” said Don Quixote in high wrath,turning upon him angrily, as his way was; “and it is a very greatslander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustriouslady, and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess wouldhave made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lieslike a great scoundrel, and I will give him to know it, on foot or onhorseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as he likes best.”Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now comeupon him, he had no disposition to go on with his story, nor would DonQuixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard aboutMadasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if shewere in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholybooks brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when heheard himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insultingnames, not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found nearhim, and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote’s breast that helaid him on his back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in thisfashion, attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged Onereceived him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretchedhim at his feet, and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his ownsatisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the samefate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietlywithdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with therage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ranto take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving themwarning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if theyhad known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves.The goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heardhim, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherdrejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by thebeard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not madepeace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.“Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,” said Sancho,grappling with the goatherd, “for of this fellow, who is a clown likemyself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for theaffront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like anhonest man.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “but I know that he is not to blamefor what has happened.”With this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would bepossible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know theend of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before,that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but thatif he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail tofall in with him either in or out of his senses.c24e.jpg (69K)Full SizeCHAPTER XXV.WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OFLA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OFBELTENEBROSc25a.jpg (168K)Full SizeDon Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mountingRocinante bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did verydiscontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the mostrugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talkwith his master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should beno breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silenceso long he said to him:“Señor Don Quixote, give me your worship’s blessing and dismissal, forI’d like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can atany rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to gothrough these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I havea mind is burying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke asthey did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because Icould talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put upwith my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne withpatience, to go seeking adventures all one’s life and get nothing butkicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to haveto sew up one’s mouth without daring to say what is in one’s heart,just as if one were dumb.”“I understand thee, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “thou art dying tohave the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider itremoved, and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in thesemountains.”“So be it,” said Sancho; “let me speak now, for God knows what willhappen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask,what made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whateverher name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend ofhers or not? for if your worship had let that pass—and you were not ajudge in the matter—it is my belief the madman would have gone on withhis story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than halfa dozen cuffs would have been escaped.”“In faith, Sancho,” answered Don Quixote, “if thou knewest as I do whatan honourable and illustrious lady Queen Madasima was, I know thouwouldst say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces themouth that uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it isto say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. The truthof the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned wasa man of great prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor andphysician to the queen, but to suppose that she was his mistress isnonsense deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardeniodid not know what he was saying, remember when he said it he was out ofhis wits.”“That is what I say,” said Sancho; “there was no occasion for mindingthe words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship,and he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, afine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, Godconfound her! And then, would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?”“Against men in their senses or against madmen,” said Don Quixote,“every knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women,whoever they may be, much more for queens of such high degree anddignity as Queen Madasima, for whom I have a particular regard onaccount of her amiable qualities; for, besides being extremelybeautiful, she was very wise, and very patient under her misfortunes,of which she had many; and the counsel and society of the MasterElisabad were a great help and support to her in enduring herafflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant andill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was hismistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two hundredtimes more, all who think and say so.”“I neither say nor think so,” said Sancho; “let them look to it; withtheir bread let them eat it; they have rendered account to God whetherthey misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I amnot fond of prying into other men’s lives; he who buys and lies feelsit in his purse; moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, Ineither lose nor gain; but if they did, what is that to me? many thinkthere are flitches where there are no hooks; but who can put gates tothe open plain? moreover they said of God—”“God bless me,” said Don Quixote, “what a set of absurdities thou artstringing together! What has what we are talking about got to do withthe proverbs thou art threading one after the other? for God’s sakehold thy tongue, Sancho, and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass anddon’t meddle in what does not concern thee; and understand with all thyfive senses that everything I have done, am doing, or shall do, is wellfounded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry, for Iunderstand them better than all the world that profess them.”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “is it a good rule of chivalry that we shouldgo astray through these mountains without path or road, looking for amadman who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what hebegan, not his story, but your worship’s head and my ribs, and end bybreaking them altogether for us?”c25b.jpg (330K)Full Size“Peace, I say again, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for let me tell theeit is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me intothese regions as that which I have of performing among them anachievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout theknown world; and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal onall that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous.”“And is it very perilous, this achievement?”“No,” replied he of the Rueful Countenance; “though it may be in thedice that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will dependon thy diligence.”“On my diligence!” said Sancho.“Yes,” said Don Quixote, “for if thou dost return soon from the placewhere I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glorywill soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer insuspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have theeknow, Sancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the mostperfect knights-errant—I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone,the first, the only one, the lord of all that were in the world in histime. A fig for Don Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him inany respect, for, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! Isay, too, that when a painter desires to become famous in his art heendeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows;and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts andcallings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he who would beesteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person andlabours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience;as Virgil, too, shows us in the person of Æneas the virtue of a piousson and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representingor describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as toleave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadiswas the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights, whomall we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound toimitate. This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that theknight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest toreaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in whichthis knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by theLady Oriana, to do penance upon the Peña Pobre, changing his name intothat of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate tothe life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for meto imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting offserpents’ heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets,and breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for asimilar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which nowso conveniently offers me its forelock.”“What is it in reality,” said Sancho, “that your worship means to do insuch an out-of-the-way place as this?”“Have I not told thee,” answered Don Quixote, “that I mean to imitateAmadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, soas at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at thefountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herselfwith Medoro and through grief thereat went mad, and plucked up trees,troubled the waters of the clear springs, slew shepherds, destroyedflocks, burned down huts, levelled houses, dragged mares after him, andperpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlastingrenown and record? And though I have no intention of imitating Roland,or Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by stepin all the mad things he did, said, and thought, I will make a roughcopy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential;but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis,who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tearsand sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.”“It seems to me,” said Sancho, “that the knights who behaved in thisway had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but whatcause has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, orwhat evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Tobosohas been trifling with Moor or Christian?”“There is the point,” replied Don Quixote, “and that is the beauty ofthis business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad whenhe has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, andlet my lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in themoist; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I haveendured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didsthear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills arefelt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising meagainst so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am,and mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter thatI mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as myconstancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; and ifit be to the opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, beingso, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shallescape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me,enjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman notfeeling the evil thou bringest me. But tell me, Sancho, hast thou gotMambrino’s helmet safe? for I saw thee take it up from the ground whenthat ungrateful wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not, bywhich the fineness of its temper may be seen.”To which Sancho made answer, “By the living God, Sir Knight of theRueful Countenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of thethings that your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect thatall you tell me about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, andgiving islands, and bestowing other rewards and dignities after thecustom of knights-errant, must be all made up of wind and lies, and allpigments or figments, or whatever we may call them; for what wouldanyone think that heard your worship calling a barber’s basinMambrino’s helmet without ever seeing the mistake all this time, butthat one who says and maintains such things must have his brainsaddled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and I am taking it hometo have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God’s grace, I amallowed to see my wife and children some day or other.”“Look here, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “by him thou didst swear by justnow I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire inthe world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hastbeen going about with me thou hast never found out that all thingsbelonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense andravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because it really isso, but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendanceupon us that change and alter everything with us, and turn things asthey please, and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us;thus what seems to thee a barber’s basin seems to me Mambrino’s helmet,and to another it will seem something else; and rare foresight it wasin the sage who is on my side to make what is really and trulyMambrino’s helmet seem a basin to everybody, for, being held in suchestimation as it is, all the world would pursue me to rob me of it; butwhen they see it is only a barber’s basin they do not take the troubleto obtain it; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it, andleft it on the ground without taking it, for, by my faith, had he knownit he would never have left it behind. Keep it safe, my friend, forjust now I have no need of it; indeed, I shall have to take off allthis armour and remain as naked as I was born, if I have a mind tofollow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.”Thus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood likean isolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its basethere flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green andluxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and foresttrees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of thespot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed hischoice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld itexclaimed in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:“This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose forbewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: thisis the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the watersof yon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stirunceasingly the leaves of these mountain trees, in testimony and tokenof the pain my persecuted heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities,whoever ye be that haunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of awretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven tobewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart ofthat fair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty!Oh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell in the thickets of theforest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooednever disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or atleast weary not at listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of mynight, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune, so mayHeaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of theplace and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, and makethat return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely trees,that from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, giveme some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence isnot distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant companion in myprosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what thou shaltsee me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the solecause of all,” and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante, and in aninstant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on thecroup, said, “He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, ohsteed as excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begonewhere thou wilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neitherAstolfo’s hippogriff, nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante sodear, could equal thee in speed.”Seeing this Sancho said, “Good luck to him who has saved us the troubleof stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not havegone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise;though if he were here I would not let anyone strip him, for therewould be no occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim ofdespair about him, inasmuch as his master, which I was while it wasGod’s pleasure, was nothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of theRueful Countenance, if my departure and your worship’s madness are tocome off in earnest, it will be as well to saddle Rocinante again inorder that he may supply the want of Dapple, because it will save metime in going and returning: for if I go on foot I don’t know when Ishall get there or when I shall get back, as I am, in truth, a badwalker.”“I declare, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “it shall be as thou wilt,for thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thouwilt depart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do andsay for her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.”“But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?” said Sancho.“Much thou knowest about it!” said Don Quixote. “I have now got to tearup my garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against theserocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.”“For the love of God,” said Sancho, “be careful, your worship, how yougive yourself those knocks on the head, for you may come across such arock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to thewhole contrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knockson the head seem necessary to you, and this business cannot be donewithout them, you might be content—as the whole thing is feigned, andcounterfeit, and in joke—you might be content, I say, with giving themto yourself in the water, or against something soft, like cotton; andleave it all to me; for I’ll tell my lady that your worship knockedyour head against a point of rock harder than a diamond.”“I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,” answered DonQuixote, “but I would have thee know that all these things I am doingare not in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be atransgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tellany lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do onething instead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on thehead must be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated orfanciful about them, and it will be needful to leave me some lint todress my wounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without thebalsam we lost.”“It was worse losing the ass,” replied Sancho, “for with him lint andall were lost; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of thataccursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at hearingthe very name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the threedays you allowed me for seeing the mad things you do, for I take themas seen already and pronounced upon, and I will tell wonderful storiesto my lady; so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long toreturn and take your worship out of this purgatory where I am leavingyou.”“Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?” said Don Quixote, “rather callit hell, or even worse if there be anything worse.”“For one who is in hell,” said Sancho, “_nulla est retentio_, as I haveheard say.”“I do not understand what _retentio_ means,” said Don Quixote.“_Retentio_,” answered Sancho, “means that whoever is in hell nevercomes nor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with yourworship or my legs will be idle, that is if I have spurs to enlivenRocinante: let me once get to El Toboso and into the presence of mylady Dulcinea, and I will tell her such things of the follies andmadnesses (for it is all one) that your worship has done and is stilldoing, that I will manage to make her softer than a glove though I findher harder than a cork tree; and with her sweet and honeyed answer Iwill come back through the air like a witch, and take your worship outof this purgatory that seems to be hell but is not, as there is hope ofgetting out of it; which, as I have said, those in hell have not, and Ibelieve your worship will not say anything to the contrary.”“That is true,” said he of the Rueful Countenance, “but how shall wemanage to write the letter?”“And the ass-colt order too,” added Sancho.“All shall be included,” said Don Quixote; “and as there is no paper,it would be well done to write it on the leaves of trees, as theancients did, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard tofind just now as paper. But it has just occurred to me how it may beconveniently and even more than conveniently written, and that is inthe notebook that belonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to haveit copied on paper, in a good hand, at the first village thou comest towhere there is a schoolmaster, or if not, any sacristan will copy it;but see thou give it not to any notary to copy, for they write a lawhand that Satan could not make out.”“But what is to be done about the signature?” said Sancho.“The letters of Amadis were never signed,” said Don Quixote.“That is all very well,” said Sancho, “but the order must needs besigned, and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and Ishall be left without ass-colts.”“The order shall go signed in the same book,” said Don Quixote, “and onseeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it; as to theloveletter thou canst put by way of signature, ‘_Yours till death, theKnight of the Rueful Countenance._’ And it will be no great matter ifit is in some other person’s hand, for as well as I recollect Dulcineacan neither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has sheseen handwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have beenalways platonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even that soseldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in allthese twelve years I have been loving her more than the light of theseeyes that the earth will one day devour; and perhaps even of those fourtimes she has not once perceived that I was looking at her: such is theretirement and seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and hermother Aldonza Nogales have brought her up.”“So, so!” said Sancho; “Lorenzo Corchuelo’s daughter is the ladyDulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?”“She it is,” said Don Quixote, “and she it is that is worthy to be ladyof the whole universe.”“I know her well,” said Sancho, “and let me tell you she can fling acrowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of all good!but she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to behelpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her hislady: the whoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I cantell you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of thevillage to call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed fieldof her father’s, and though they were better than half a league offthey heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower; andthe best of her is that she is not a bit prudish, for she has plenty ofaffability, and jokes with everybody, and has a grin and a jest foreverything. So, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I say you notonly may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake, but you have a goodright to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who knows ofit but will say you did well, though the devil should take you; and Iwish I were on my road already, simply to see her, for it is many a daysince I saw her, and she must be altered by this time, for going aboutthe fields always, and the sun and the air spoil women’s looks greatly.But I must own the truth to your worship, Señor Don Quixote; until nowI have been under a great mistake, for I believed truly and honestlythat the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in lovewith, or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you havesent her, such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves, and many more nodoubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when Iwas not yet your squire. But all things considered, what good can it dothe lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to havethe vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and goingdown on their knees before her? Because maybe when they came she’d behackling flax or threshing on the threshing floor, and they’d beashamed to see her, and she’d laugh, or resent the present.”“I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“that thou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thouart always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou artand how rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thoumust know that a certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, andabove all free and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping younglay-brother; his superior came to know of it, and one day said to theworthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance, ‘I am surprised, señora,and not without good reason, that a woman of such high standing, sofair, and so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such amean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this house there are somany masters, graduates, and divinity students from among whom youmight choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying, ‘This one I’lltake, that I won’t take;’ but she replied to him with greatsprightliness and candour, ‘My dear sir, you are very much mistaken,and your ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made abad choice in So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want withhim he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.’ In the sameway, Sancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just asgood as the most exalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposedthat all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancynames they give them, had any such mistresses. Thinkest thou that theAmarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, the Galateas, theFílidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, thebarber’s shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly ladiesof flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and haveglorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the mostpart to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass forlovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me tothink and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous;and as to her pedigree it is very little matter, for no one willexamine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her, andI, for my part, reckon her the most exalted princess in the world. Forthou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two thingsalone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are greatbeauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found inDulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and ingood name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, Ipersuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, andI picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well inbeauty as in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia comeup to her, nor any other of the famous women of times past, Greek,Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he will, for if in this I amtaken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by thecritical.”“I say that your worship is entirely right,” said Sancho, “and that Iam an ass. But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for arope is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged;but now for the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.”Don Quixote took out the notebook, and, retiring to one side, verydeliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it hecalled to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he mightcommit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evilfortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sanchoreplied, “Write it two or three times there in the book and give it tome, and I will carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep itin my memory is all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I oftenforget my own name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall liketo hear it, for surely it will run as if it was in print.”“Listen,” said Don Quixote, “this is what it says:_“Don Quixote’s Letter to Dulcinea del Toboso_“Sovereign and exalted Lady,—The pierced by the point of absence, thewounded to the heart’s core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso,the health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beauty despises me, ifthy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is my affliction, though I besufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall I endure this anxiety, which,besides being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire Sancho willrelate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition towhich I am reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give merelief, I am thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for byending my life I shall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire.    “Thine till death,    “The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”“By the life of my father,” said Sancho, when he heard the letter, “itis the loftiest thing I ever heard. Body of me! how your worship sayseverything as you like in it! And how well you fit in ‘The Knight ofthe Rueful Countenance’ into the signature. I declare your worship isindeed the very devil, and there is nothing you don’t know.”“Everything is needed for the calling I follow,” said Don Quixote.“Now then,” said Sancho, “let your worship put the order for the threeass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they mayrecognise it at first sight.”“With all my heart,” said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he readit to this effect:“Mistress Niece,—By this first of ass-colts please pay to Sancho Panza,my squire, three of the five I left at home in your charge: said threeass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here inhand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. Done inthe heart of the Sierra Morena, the twenty-seventh of August of thispresent year.”“That will do,” said Sancho; “now let your worship sign it.”“There is no need to sign it,” said Don Quixote, “but merely to put myflourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses,or even three hundred.”“I can trust your worship,” returned Sancho; “let me go and saddleRocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go atonce without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I’ll sayI saw you do so many that she will not want any more.”“At any rate, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “I should like—and there isreason for it—I should like thee, I say, to see me stripped to the skinand performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done inless than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thoucanst then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and Ipromise thee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.”“For the love of God, master mine,” said Sancho, “let me not see yourworship stripped, for it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be ableto keep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night forDapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is yourworship’s pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in yourclothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myselfwant nothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving oftime for my return, which will be with the news your worship desiresand deserves. If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does notanswer reasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch afair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should itbe borne that a knight-errant as famous as your worship should go madwithout rhyme or reason for a—? Her ladyship had best not drive me tosay it, for by God I will speak out and let off everything cheap, evenif it doesn’t sell: I am pretty good at that! she little knows me;faith, if she knew me she’d be in awe of me.”“In faith, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “to all appearance thou art nosounder in thy wits than I.”“I am not so mad,” answered Sancho, “but I am more peppery; but apartfrom all this, what has your worship to eat until I come back? Will yousally out on the road like Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?”“Let not that anxiety trouble thee,” replied Don Quixote, “for even ifI had it I should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits whichthis meadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this businessof mine lies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.”“Do you know what I am afraid of?” said Sancho upon this; “that I shallnot be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, itis such an out-of-the-way place.”“Observe the landmarks well,” said Don Quixote, “for I will try not togo far from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount thehighest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning;however, not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cutsome branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thougoest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain;these will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinthof Theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return.”“So I will,” said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked hismaster’s blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took hisleave of him, and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged himearnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for theplain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master hadrecommended him; and so he went his way, though Don Quixote stillentreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. He hadnot gone a hundred paces, however, when he returned and said:“I must say, señor, your worship said quite right, that in order to beable to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had seen you domad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; thoughin your worship’s remaining here I have seen a very great one.”c25c.jpg (261K)Full Size“Did I not tell thee so?” said Don Quixote. “Wait, Sancho, and I willdo them in the saying of a credo,” and pulling off his breeches in allhaste he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, withoutmore ado, he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple ofsomersaults, heels over head, making such a display that, not to see ita second time, Sancho wheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, andsatisfied in his mind that he could swear he had left his master mad;and so we will leave him to follow his road until his return, which wasa quick one.c25e.jpg (20K)CHAPTER XXVI.IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THEPART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA MORENAc26a.jpg (111K)Full SizeReturning to the proceedings of him of the Rueful Countenance when hefound himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote hadcompleted the performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from thewaist down and clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had goneoff without waiting to see any more crazy feats, he climbed up to thetop of a high rock, and there set himself to consider what he hadseveral times before considered without ever coming to any conclusionon the point, namely whether it would be better and more to his purposeto imitate the outrageous madness of Roland, or the melancholy madnessof Amadis; and communing with himself he said:“What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant aseveryone says he was, when, after all, he was enchanted, and nobodycould kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of hisfoot, and he always wore shoes with seven iron soles? Though cunningdevices did not avail him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew allabout them, and strangled him in his arms at Roncesvalles. But puttingthe question of his valour aside, let us come to his losing his wits,for certain it is that he did lose them in consequence of the proofs hediscovered at the fountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave himof Angelica having slept more than two siestas with Medoro, a littlecurly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante. If he was persuaded that thiswas true, and that his lady had wronged him, it is no wonder that heshould have gone mad; but I, how am I to imitate him in his madness,unless I can imitate him in the cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I willventure to swear, never saw a Moor in her life, as he is, in his propercostume, and she is this day as the mother that bore her, and I shouldplainly be doing her a wrong if, fancying anything else, I were to gomad with the same kind of madness as Roland the Furious. On the otherhand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, without losing his senses and withoutdoing anything mad, acquired as a lover as much fame as the mostfamous; for, according to his history, on finding himself rejected byhis lady Oriana, who had ordered him not to appear in her presenceuntil it should be her pleasure, all he did was to retire to the PeñaPobre in company with a hermit, and there he took his fill of weepinguntil Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief and need.And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble tostrip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me noharm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks whichwill give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory ofAmadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote ofLa Mancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that ifhe did not achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if Iam not repulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as Ihave said, to be absent from her. And so, now to business; come to mymemory ye deeds of Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitateyou. I know already that what he chiefly did was to pray and commendhimself to God; but what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not gotone?”And then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was bytearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, andmaking eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this servedhim for a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeatedcountless ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not havinganother hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; andso he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, andwriting and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand amultitude of verses all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praiseof Dulcinea; but, when he was found there afterwards, the only onescompletely legible that could be discovered were those that followhere:Ye on the mountainside that grow,Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes,Are ye aweary of the woeThat this poor aching bosom crushes?If it disturb you, and I oweSome reparation, it may be aDefence for me to let you knowDon Quixote’s tears are on the flow,And all for distant DulcineaDel Toboso.The lealest lover time can show,Doomed for a lady-love to languish,Among these solitudes doth go,A prey to every kind of anguish.Why Love should like a spiteful foeThus use him, he hath no idea,But hogsheads full—this doth he know—Don Quixote’s tears are on the flow,And all for distant DulcineaDel Toboso.Adventure-seeking doth he goUp rugged heights, down rocky valleys,But hill or dale, or high or low,Mishap attendeth all his sallies:Love still pursues him to and fro,And plies his cruel scourge—ah me! aRelentless fate, an endless woe;Don Quixote’s tears are on the flow,And all for distant DulcineaDel Toboso.The addition of “Del Toboso” to Dulcinea’s name gave rise to no littlelaughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected DonQuixote must have fancied that unless he added “del Toboso” when heintroduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible;which was indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrotemany more, but, as has been said, these three verses were all thatcould be plainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighingand calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of thestreams, and Echo, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hearhim, as well as in looking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his timeuntil Sancho’s return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it wasthree days, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn suchan altered countenance that the mother that bore him would not haveknown him: and here it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighsand verses, to relate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.As for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, andthe next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket hadbefallen him. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were oncemore living through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter itthough it was an hour when he might well have done so, for it wasdinner-time, and he longed to taste something hot as it had been allcold fare with him for many days past. This craving drove him to drawnear to the inn, still undecided whether to go in or not, and as he washesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him, andsaid one to the other:“Señor licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, ouradventurer’s housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?”“So it is,” said the licentiate, “and that is our friend Don Quixote’shorse;” and if they knew him so well it was because they were thecurate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried outthe scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as theyrecognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of DonQuixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said,“Friend Sancho Panza, where is your master?”Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the placeand circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so hereplied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certainmatter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for theeyes in his head.“Nay, nay,” said the barber, “if you don’t tell us where he is, SanchoPanza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murderedand robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, youmust produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.”“There is no need of threats with me,” said Sancho, “for I am not a manto rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, killeach one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance inthe midst of these mountains;” and then, offhand and without stopping,he told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, andhow he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, thedaughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears inlove. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for thoughthey were aware of Don Quixote’s madness and the nature of it, eachtime they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They thenasked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the ladyDulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that hismaster’s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at thefirst village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it tohim, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand intohis bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if hehad been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixotehad kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thoughtof asking for it. When Sancho discovered he could not find the book hisface grew deadly pale, and in great haste he again felt his body allover, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without more ado heseized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it, and then,as quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half a dozencuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.Seeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened himthat he gave himself such rough treatment.“What should happen to me?” replied Sancho, “but to have lost from onehand to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like acastle?”“How is that?” said the barber.“I have lost the notebook,” said Sancho, “that contained the letter toDulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed hisniece to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;”and he then told them about the loss of Dapple.The curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found hewould get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, aswas usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were neveraccepted or honoured.Sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the lossof Dulcinea’s letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost byheart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever theyliked.“Repeat it then, Sancho,” said the barber, “and we will write it downafterwards.”Sancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter tohis memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, onemoment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after havinghalf gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waitingfor him to begin, he said, after a long pause, “By God, señorlicentiate, devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said atthe beginning, ‘Exalted and scrubbing Lady.’”“It cannot have said ‘scrubbing,’” said the barber, “but ‘superhuman’or ‘sovereign.’”“That is it,” said Sancho; “then, as well as I remember, it went on,‘The wounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses yourworship’s hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it saidsomething or other about health and sickness that he was sending her;and from that it went tailing off until it ended with ‘Yours tilldeath, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.’”It gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a goodmemory Sancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, andbegged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that theytoo might get it by heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated itthree times, and as he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities;then he told them more about his master but he never said a word aboutthe blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which herefused to enter. He told them, moreover, how his lord, if he broughthim a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to puthimself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least amonarch; for it had been so settled between them, and with his personalworth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come to be one:and how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for him (for hewould be a widower by that time, as a matter of course) and was to givehim as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the heiress of somerich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islandsof any sort, for he did not care for them now. All this Sanchodelivered with so much composure—wiping his nose from time to time—andwith so little common-sense that his two hearers were again filled withwonder at the force of Don Quixote’s madness that could run away withthis poor man’s reason. They did not care to take the trouble ofdisabusing him of his error, as they considered that since it did notin any way hurt his conscience it would be better to leave him in it,and they would have all the more amusement in listening to hissimplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord’s health,as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in course oftime to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an archbishop orsome other dignitary of equal rank.To which Sancho made answer, “If fortune, sirs, should bring thingsabout in such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of beingan emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know whatarchbishops-errant commonly give their squires?”“They commonly give them,” said the curate, some simple benefice orcure, or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income,not counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.”“But for that,” said Sancho, “the squire must be unmarried, and mustknow, at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me,for I am married already and I don’t know the first letter of the A BC. What will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be anarchbishop and not an emperor, as is usual and customary withknights-errant?”“Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,” said the barber, “for we will entreatyour master, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case ofconscience, to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it willbe easier for him as he is more valiant than lettered.”“So I have thought,” said Sancho; “though I can tell you he is fit foranything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to placehim where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestowmost favours upon me.”“You speak like a man of sense,” said the curate, “and you will beacting like a good Christian; but what must now be done is to takesteps to coax your master out of that useless penance you say he isperforming; and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan toadopt, and also to dine, for it is now time.”Sancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there outside, andthat he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, andwhy it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring himout something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barleyfor Rocinante. They left him and went in, and presently the barberbrought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had betweenthem carefully thought over what they should do to carry out theirobject, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour DonQuixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explainedto the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of awandering damsel, while the other should try as best he could to passfor a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixotewas, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel,should ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he couldnot refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that heshould accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redressa wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the same time sheshould entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor ask herany question touching her circumstances until he had righted her withthe wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don Quixote would complywith any request made in these terms, and that in this way they mightremove him and take him to his own village, where they would endeavourto find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind ofremedy.c26e.jpg (48K)CHAPTER XXVII.OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHERWITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORYc27a.jpg (169K)Full SizeThe curate’s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on thecontrary so good that they immediately set about putting it inexecution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leavingher in pledge a new cassock of the curate’s; and the barber made abeard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used tostick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these thingsfor, and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of DonQuixote, and how this disguise was intended to get him away from themountain where he then was. The landlord and landlady immediately cameto the conclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man andmaster of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that hadpassed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been sosilent about. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a stylethat left nothing to be desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat withblack velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of greenvelvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as thepetticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The curatewould not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linencap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a stripof black silk, while with another he made a mask with which heconcealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, whichwas broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himselfin his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barbermounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white,for it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as shewas, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant themsuccess in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they hadin hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struckthe curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in thatfashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himselfthat way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to thebarber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should bethe distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire’s part,which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he wasresolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the deviltake Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing thepair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; thebarber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering theirplan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and whatto say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them andgive up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. Thebarber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction,and as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near whereDon Quixote was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted hisbeard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who wentalong telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in theSierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of the valise andits contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a triflecovetous.The next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid thebroom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master,and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and thatthey would do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliverhis master; for they had already told him that going in this guise anddressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescuehis master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they chargedhim strictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knewthem, and should he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter toDulcinea, to say that he had, and that, as she did not know how toread, she had given an answer by word of mouth, saying that shecommanded him, on pain of her displeasure, to come and see her at once;and it was a very important matter for himself, because in this way andwith what they meant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him backto a better mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps tobecome an emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his becoming anarchbishop. All this Sancho listened to and fixed it well in hismemory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his masterto be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he felt sure that in theway of bestowing rewards on their squires emperors could do more thanarchbishops-errant. He said, too, that it would be as well for him togo on before them to find him, and give him his lady’s answer; for thatperhaps might be enough to bring him away from the place withoutputting them to all this trouble. They approved of what Sanchoproposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back word ofhaving found his master.Sancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in onethrough which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocksand trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day withall the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and thehour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the moreinviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho’s return, which theydid. They were reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompaniedby the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone,reached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as theplace did not seem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well;for though it is often said that shepherds of rare voice are to befound in the woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet’sfancy than the truth. And still more surprised were they when theyperceived that what they heard sung were the verses not of rusticshepherds, but of the polished wits of the city; and so it proved, forthe verses they heard were these:What makes my quest of happiness seem vain?Disdain.What bids me to abandon hope of ease?Jealousies.What holds my heart in anguish of suspense?Absence.If that be so, then for my griefWhere shall I turn to seek relief,When hope on every side lies slainBy Absence, Jealousies, Disdain?What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?Love.What at my glory ever looks askance?Chance.Whence is permission to afflict me given?Heaven.If that be so, I but awaitThe stroke of a resistless fate,Since, working for my woe, these three,Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.What must I do to find a remedy?Die.What is the lure for love when coy and strange?Change.What, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?Madness.If that be so, it is but follyTo seek a cure for melancholy:Ask where it lies; the answer saithIn Change, in Madness, or in Death.The hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill ofthe singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the twolisteners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding,however, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved togo in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just asthey were about to do so they were checked by the same voice, whichonce more fell upon their ears, singing thisSONNETWhen heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst goSoaring to seek thy home beyond the sky,And take thy seat among the saints on high,It was thy will to leave on earth belowThy semblance, and upon it to bestowThy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy,Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye,And makes its vileness bright as virtue show.Friendship, return to us, or force the cheatThat wears it now, thy livery to restore,By aid whereof sincerity is slain.If thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit,This earth will be the prey of strife once more,As when primæval discord held its reign.The song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remainedwaiting attentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that themusic had now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined tofind out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as hissighs were piteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning thecorner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect andappearance as Sancho had described to them when he told them the storyof Cardenio. He, showing no astonishment when he saw them, stood stillwith his head bent down upon his breast like one in deep thought,without raising his eyes to look at them after the first glance whenthey suddenly came upon him. The curate, who was aware of hismisfortune and recognised him by the description, being a man of goodaddress, approached him and in a few sensible words entreated and urgedhim to quit a life of such misery, lest he should end it there, whichwould be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was then in hisright mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequentlycarried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual amongthe frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise,especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were awell-known matter (for the curate’s words gave him to understand asmuch) so he replied to them thus:“I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it isto succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in thisremote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserveit not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some betterretreat, showing me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably Iact in leading the life I do; but as they know, that if I escape fromthis evil I shall fall into another still greater, perhaps they willset me down as a weak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid ofreason; nor would it be any wonder, for I myself can perceive that theeffect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works sopowerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like astone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel the truthof it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have donewhen the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lotin vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by tellinghow it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonablebeings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if theycannot help me at least they will not blame me, and the repugnance theyfeel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes. If it be, sirs,that you are here with the same design as others have come with, beforeyou proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hear the storyof my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it youwill spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offeringconsolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.”As they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his ownlips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it,promising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did notwish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearlythe same words and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote andthe goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and DonQuixote’s scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the talewas left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but nowfortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end;and so, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had foundin the volume of “Amadis of Gaul,” Cardenio said that he remembered itperfectly and that it was in these words:“_Luscinda to Cardenio._“Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to holdyou in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of thisobligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have afather who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting anyconstraint on my inclination will grant what will be reasonable for youto have, if it be that you value me as you say and as I believe youdo.”“By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for mywife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by DonFernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, andthis letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before minecould be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda’sfather was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I didnot dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;not because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue,and beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honourto any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish meto marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me.In short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, aswell on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouragedme though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to methat what I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernandoanswered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, andpersuade him to speak to Luscinda’s father. O, ambitious Marius! O,cruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherousVellido! O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel,vindictive, and perfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in hisfidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joysof his heart? What offence did I commit? What words did I utter, orwhat counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy honour andwelfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? forsure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending fromon high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power onearth can check their course nor human device stay their coming. Whocould have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman,intelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services, one that couldwin the object of his love wherever he might set his affections, couldhave become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lambthat was not even yet in my possession? But laying aside these uselessand unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread of myunhappy story.“To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to theexecution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me tohis elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay forsix horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending meaway that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he hadpurchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and the priceof which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated thistreachery? Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far fromthat, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in mysatisfaction at the good bargain that had been made. That night I spokewith Luscinda, and told her what had been agreed upon with DonFernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishesbeing realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of DonFernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she believed thefulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my fatherput off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this tome her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat thatprevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to meshe was striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn,which I never before observed in her, for we always conversed, whenevergood fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatestgaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, orfears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortunethat Heaven should have given her to me for my mistress; I glorifiedher beauty, I extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid meback by praising in me what in her love for me she thought worthy ofpraise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of ourneighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of myboldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands andcarry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating thatseparated us allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of mydeparture she wept, she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving mefilled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of suchstrange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not todash my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and thepain that separation gives those who love tenderly. At last I took mydeparture, sad and dejected, my heart filled with fancies andsuspicions, but not knowing well what it was I suspected or fancied;plain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaitingme.“I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to DonFernando’s brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,for he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days insome place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as hisbrother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; allof which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brotherhad no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once.“The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeyingit, as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many daysseparated from Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowfulmood I have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant Iobeyed, though I felt it would be at the cost of my well-being. Butfour days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which hegave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, asthe writing was hers. I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuadedthat it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to mewhen at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. Beforereading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and howlong he had been upon the road; he told me that as he happened to bepassing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, avery beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in hereyes said to him hurriedly, ‘Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, aChristian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letterdespatched without a moment’s delay to the place and person named inthe address, all which is well known, and by this you will render agreat service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience indoing so take what is in this handkerchief;’ and said he, ‘with thisshe threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up ahundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with theletter I have given you. And then without waiting for any answer sheleft the window, though not before she saw me take the letter and thehandkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as shebade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I wouldhave in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was toyou it was sent (for, señor, I know you very well), and also unable toresist that beautiful lady’s tears, I resolved to trust no one else,but to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from thetime when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know,is eighteen leagues.’“All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this,I hung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I couldscarcely stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine,he has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to youradvantage. I have to tell you, señor, that he has demanded me for awife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando’ssuperiority over you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in twodays hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and soprivately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a fewof the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it beurgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether Ilove you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shallbe forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that hehas pledged.“Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me setout at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I nowsaw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his ownpleasure that had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. Theexasperation I felt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear oflosing the prize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lentme wings; so that almost flying I reached home the same day, by thehour which served for speaking with Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, andleft the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy man whohad brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once sokind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of ourloves. She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as she ought tohave recognised me, or I her. But who is there in the world that canboast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstablenature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as soon as Luscindasaw me she said, ‘Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and thetreacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me inthe hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of mydeath before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend,but contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot beprevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will preventmore deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee afirst proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.’ I replied to herdistractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply,‘May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast adagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill myselfif fortune be against us.’“I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived thatthey called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now thenight of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt myeyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house,nor was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it wasthat I should be present at what might take place on the occasion, Inerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all theentrances and outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secretpervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, Ifound an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a windowof the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of twotapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see allthat took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heartI suffered as I stood there—the thoughts that came to me—thereflections that passed through my mind? They were such as cannot be,nor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that thebridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress, without ornament of anykind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of Luscinda’s and exceptthe servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber. Soonafterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, attended by hermother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her rankand beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety anddistraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what shewore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white,and the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel,surpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying withthe precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in thehall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of mypeace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adoredenemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me andrecall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I mayseek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be notweary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one ofthose that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me eachincident seems to call for many words.”To this the curate replied that not only were they not weary oflistening to him, but that the details he mentioned interested themgreatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of thesame attention as the main story.“To proceed, then,” continued Cardenio: “all being assembled in thehall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by thehand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, ‘Will you, SeñoraLuscinda, take Señor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawfulhusband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?’ I thrust my head and neckout from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbingheart set myself to listen to Luscinda’s answer, awaiting in her replythe sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared atthat moment to rush forward crying aloud, ‘Luscinda, Luscinda! have acare what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou artmine and canst not be another’s; reflect that thy utterance of “Yes”and the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherousDon Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?Remember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thywishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!’ Fool that Iam! now that I am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have donewhat I did not do: now that I have allowed my precious treasure to berobbed from me, I curse the robber, on whom I might have takenvengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for bewailing my fate;in short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little wonder is it if Iam now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.“The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a longtime withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the daggerto save her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration ofthe truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, ‘Iwill:’ Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stoodlinked by a knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom thenapproached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon herheart, fell fainting in her mother’s arms. It only remains now for meto tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I sawall my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda provedfalsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lostrendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, itseemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, theair refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears;it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frameglowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion byLuscinda’s fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her aira sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized atonce and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon ashe had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on hishand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part inthe efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her faintingfit.“Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come outregardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to dosome frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteousindignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous DonFernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress. But myfate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, soordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reasonwhich has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to takevengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken,as all thought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to takeit upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved,perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to themhad I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which isprotracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word,I quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left mymule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding himfarewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring toturn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in theopen country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by thestillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear ofbeing heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice inmaledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avengethe wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false,thankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy hadblinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer itto one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, inthe midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I foundexcuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in theseclusion of her parents’ house, trained and schooled to obey themalways, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when theyoffered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, andnoble birth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have beenthought out of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, asuspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said,had she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that inchoosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her,for before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could nothave desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a moreeligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before takingthe last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that Ihad already given her mine, for I should have come forward to supportany assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to theconclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and acraving for rank, had made her forget the words with which she haddeceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourablepassion.“Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainderof the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of thesemountains, among which I wandered for three days more without takingany path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know notwhich side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen inwhat direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me thatit was in this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither,intending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among thesecrags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I thinkmore likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as itbore in me. I was left on foot, worn out, famishing, without anyone tohelp me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus I lay stretched onthe ground, how long I know not, after which I rose up free fromhunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were thepersons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they hadfound me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I hadlost my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always infull possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do athousand mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in thesesolitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the dear name of herwho is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; andwhen I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and weary that Ican scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a corktree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen andgoatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish mewith food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they thinkI may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then outof my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustainme, and make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so theytell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon theroad, and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by forcefrom the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus dopass the wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven’s will tobring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longerrecollect the beauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me byDon Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, Iwill turn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can onlyimplore it to have full mercy on my soul, for in myself I feel no poweror strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of myown accord chosen to place it.“Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be onethat can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do nottrouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggestsas likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as themedicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who willnot take it. I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since itis her pleasure to be another’s, when she is or should be mine, let itbe mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. Sheby her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will striveto gratify her wishes by seeking destruction; and it will showgenerations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which allothers in misfortune have a superabundance, for to them theimpossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation, while to me itis the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings, for I think that evenin death there will not be an end of them.”Here Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as fullof misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going toaddress some words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice thatreached his ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in theFourth Part of this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacioushistorian, Cid Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.c27e.jpg (65K)CHAPTER XXVIII.WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THECURATE AND THE BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRAc28a.jpg (159K)Full SizeHappy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight DonQuixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of hishaving formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to reviveand restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order ofknight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in lightentertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also ofthe tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no lesspleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which,resuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as thecurate was going to offer consolation to Cardenio, he was interruptedby a voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones:“O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secretgrave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? Ifthe solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woeis me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of theserocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven,than that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to forcounsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!”All this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and asit seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got upto look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces theydiscovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth inthe dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment tosee as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook thatflowed past. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them,being fully occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that theylooked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the otherstones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck themwith surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clodsor to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner’s dress suggested;and so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was infront, made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind somefragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing closelywhat the youth was about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brownjacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth; he wore besidesbreeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera;and he had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, whichverily seemed to be of pure alabaster.c28b.jpg (339K)Full SizeAs soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with atowel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised hisface, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing abeauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:“As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.”The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side toside there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams ofthe sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed apeasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two ofthem had ever beheld, or even Cardenio’s if they had not seen and knownLuscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscindacould compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered hershoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her allround beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her formwas visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet hadseemed like bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like piecesof driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only theadmiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who shewas. With this object they resolved to show themselves, and at the stirthey made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head,and parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands, she lookedto see who had made the noise, and the instant she perceived them shestarted to her feet, and without waiting to put on her shoes or gatherup her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that shehad beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight;but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, her delicatefeet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which,the three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her firstsaid:“Stay, señora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here onlydesire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight soheedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.”Taken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words.They, however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went onto say:“What your dress would hide, señora, is made known to us by your hair;a clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised yourbeauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes likethese where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieveyour distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so longas life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to makethe sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention.And so, señora, or señor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss thefears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted withyour good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from eachone of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble.”While the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as ifspell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering aword, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he hasnever seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressingsome further words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she brokesilence and said:“Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me,and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue todeal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any furtherpretence of what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more outof courtesy than for any other reason. This being so, I say I thankyou, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under theobligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though Ifear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in youas much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggestanything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them. However,that my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, nowthat you have discovered me to be a woman, and see that I am young,alone, and in this dress, things that taken together or separatelywould be enough to destroy any good name, I feel bound to tell what Iwould willingly keep secret if I could.”All this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered withoutany hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that theywere not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and asthey again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil herpromise, she without further pressing, first modestly covering her feetand gathering up her hair, seated herself on a stone with the threeplaced around her, and, after an effort to restrain some tears thatcame to her eyes, in a clear and steady voice began her story thus:“In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a titlewhich makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. Thisnobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently tohis good qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it bethe treachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents arethis lord’s vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth hadconferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing leftto desire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that inwhich I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came oftheirs in not having been nobly born. It is true they are not so lowthat they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition, but neitherare they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that mymishap comes of their humble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plainhomely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, as thesaying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth andfree-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be consideredgentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth andnobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and asthey have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionateparents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parentsindulged.“I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of theirold age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all theirwishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knewtheir worth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also oftheir possessions. Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants;through my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown andreaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks andherds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father hasor can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistresswith an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannotwell describe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had giventhe requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and otherlabourers, I passed in such employments as are not only allowable butnecessary for young girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion,and spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quittedthem for a while, I found recreation in reading some devotional book orplaying the harp, for experience taught me that music soothes thetroubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I ledin my parents’ house and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is notout of ostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you maysee how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happycondition I have described, to the misery I am in at present. The truthis, that while I was leading this busy life, in a retirement that mightcompare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any exceptthe servants of the house (for when I went to Mass it was so early inthe morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and the womenof the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyesscarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, theeyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx’scannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of DonFernando; for that is the name of the younger son of the duke I toldof.”The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardeniochanged colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion thatthe curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the madfits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; butCardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding thepeasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was.She, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuingher story, went on to say:“And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, hewas smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which itdisplayed itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of mywoes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by DonFernando for declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household,he gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day waslike a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one couldsleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, noone knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges,containing more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; allwhich not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, asif he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make meyield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bredbearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found hisimportunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfactionto find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction,and I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters (forhowever ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us tohear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right wasopposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, whonow very plainly perceived Don Fernando’s purpose, for he cared verylittle if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confidedtheir honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bademe consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which Imight conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to thecontrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage;and if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to hisunreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once toanyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, orof any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my goodname, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and theirsound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernandoa word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, howeverremote.c28c.jpg (279K)Full Size“All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, hadapparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite—for that is thename I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it tobe, you would not know of it now, because there would have been nooccasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents werecontemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes ofobtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectorsto watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act asyou shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no othercompanion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefullylocked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, Iknow not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusionand these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of myretirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astoundedme that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had nopower to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one,as he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for,overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he beganto make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could havehad the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and thetraitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and hissighs for his sincerity.“I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in casessuch as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lyingprotestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tearsto anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling ofbewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself,I said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed,‘If, as I am now in your arms, señor, I were in the claws of a fiercelion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anythingto the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do itor say it, than it would be possible that what was should not havebeen; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soulsecured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you willsee if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am yourvassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor shouldhave any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-bornpeasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord andgentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealthwill have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, noryour sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things Ispeak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will shouldbe mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour beingpreserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yieldhim what you, señor, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest youshould suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anythingof me.’ ‘If that,’ said this disloyal gentleman, ‘be the only scrupleyou feel, fairest Dorothea’ (for that is the name of this unhappybeing), ‘see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, fromwhich nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, bewitnesses of this pledge.’”c28d.jpg (289K)Full SizeWhen Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed freshagitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, buthe was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end ofwhat he already all but knew, so he merely said:“What! is Dorothea your name, señora? I have heard of another of thesame name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed;by-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as itwill excite your compassion.”Dorothea was struck by Cardenio’s words as well as by his strange andmiserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her totell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it wascourage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt surethat none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what sheendured already.“I would not let the occasion pass, señora,” replied Cardenio, “oftelling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so farthere has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you toknow it.”“Be it as it may,” replied Dorothea, “what happened in my story wasthat Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed itas a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words andextravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; thoughbefore he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider wellwhat he was doing, and think of the anger his father would feel atseeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told himnot to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was notenough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the lovehe bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lotto follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriagesso unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long toafford the enjoyment they began with.“All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which Icannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego hispurpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himselfabout difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time Iargued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, ‘I shallnot be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a loftystation, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is morelikely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank.Then, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as wellavail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though hisinclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, Ishall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel himby scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to useforce, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of provingmy innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to bein this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents thatthis gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?’“All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment;but the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tearshe shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace,which, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well haveconquered a heart even more free and coy than mine—these were thethings that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares tomy ruin. I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witnesson earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed andrepeated his oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition tothe former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereaftershould he fail to keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled hissighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which he had neverallowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to beone, and he became a traitor and a perjured man.“The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come soquickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire hasattained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene ofpleasure. I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, andby the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admittedhim, gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me hetold me, though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when hecame, that I might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity andsincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ringoff his finger and placed it upon mine. He then took his departure andI was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, Iwas left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by whathad taken place, and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur tome, to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of inconcealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as yet I was unable to makeup my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil. I toldDon Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he might see me onother nights in the same way, until it should be his pleasure to letthe matter become known; but, except the following night, he came nomore, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in thestreet or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one;although I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went outhunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad anddreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I began todoubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of DonFernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproofof her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was forced toput a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance,not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, anddrive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was suddenlybrought to an end, for the time came when all such considerations weredisregarded, and there was no further question of honour, when mypatience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad. Thereason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that DonFernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rarebeauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though notso rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant amatch; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at thebetrothal some strange things had happened.”Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged hisshoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams oftears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt herstory, but went on in these words:“This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struckwith a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that Iscarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, cryingaloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I wasthe victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by aresolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was toassume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father’s, one ofthe zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided thewhole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to thecity where I heard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me formy boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon mypurpose, offered to bear me company, as he said, to the end of theworld. I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman’s dress, andsome jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence ofthe night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forthfrom the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, andon foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by myeagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be alreadydone, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with whatconscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and ahalf, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda’sparents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I soughtto know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred atthe betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of suchnotoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers inthe street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando’s betrothal withLuscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying ‘Yes,’she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroomapproaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he founda paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that shecould not be Don Fernando’s bride, because she was already Cardenio’s,who, according to the man’s account, was a gentleman of distinction ofthe same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was onlyin obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the papermade it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of thebetrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all whichwas confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in herclothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda hadbefooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she hadrecovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger thathad been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and thosewho were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that DonFernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from herprostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she wasreally the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besidesthat Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal;and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he hadquitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring thewrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no oneshould ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in thecity, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known thatLuscinda was missing from her father’s house and from the city, for shewas not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, whoknew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived myhopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than tofind him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yetentirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heavenhad put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead himto recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that asa Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects.All this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself withoutcomfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that lifethat I now abhor.“But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not findDon Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a greatreward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of myage and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad whocame with me had taken me away from my father’s house; a thing that cutme to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it wasnot enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add withwhom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of myconsideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city withmy servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity tome, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the mostthickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, oneevil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be thebeginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for myworthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me inthis lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty,sought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudesseemed to present him, and with little shame and less fear of God andrespect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that Ireplied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language,he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and beganto use violence.c28e.jpg (324K)Full Size“But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid goodintentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with littleexertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether deador alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possiblein my terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without anyother thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, andescaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders.It is now I know not how many months since with this object I camehere, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a placein the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving himas herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which havenow unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains wereunavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, andharboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does notalways supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipiceor ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion,as I had in the servant’s case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave himand again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of mystrength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went intohiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tearsimplore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help andstrength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leavingno trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnishedmatter for talk and scandal at home and abroad.”c28f.jpg (42K)CHAPTER XXIX.WHICH TREATS OF THE DROLL DEVICE AND METHOD ADOPTED TO EXTRICATE OURLOVE-STRICKEN KNIGHT FROM THE SEVERE PENANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPONHIMSELFc29a.jpg (99K)Full Size“Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge foryourselves now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and thetears that flowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I hadindulged in them more freely; and if you consider the nature of mymisfortune you will see that consolation is idle, as there is nopossible remedy for it. All I ask of you is, what you may easily andreasonably do, to show me where I may pass my life unharassed by thefear and dread of discovery by those who are in search of me; forthough the great love my parents bear me makes me feel sure of beingkindly received by them, so great is my feeling of shame at the merethought that I cannot present myself before them as they expect, that Ihad rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them inthe face with the reflection that they beheld mine stripped of thatpurity they had a right to expect in me.”With these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread herface showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart. Intheirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes;but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation andadvice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, “So then, señora, you are thefair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?” Dorothea wasastonished at hearing her father’s name, and at the miserableappearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said howwretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him:“And who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father’s name sowell? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in thewhole story of my misfortunes.”“I am that unhappy being, señora,” replied Cardenio, “whom, as you havesaid, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunateCardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to yourpresent condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged,bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I onlypossess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it tome. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando,and waited to hear the ‘Yes’ uttered by which Luscinda owned herselfhis betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to see how herfainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in herbosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokesof ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, andleaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place inLuscinda’s hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to endhere the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would notrid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhapsto preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for ifthat which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it maybe that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination toour misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannotmarry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so openly declared,and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we mayreasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it isstill in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we havethis consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, Ientreat you, señora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as Imean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happierfortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and aChristian not to desert you until I see you in possession of DonFernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise hisobligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which myrank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him onaccount of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs,which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myselfto yours.”Cardenio’s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and notknowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kisshis feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate repliedfor both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly,begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, wherethey might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measuresto discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or dowhat seemed to them most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him,and accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had beenlistening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindlywords also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered hisservices in any way that might be of use to them. He also explained tothem in a few words the object that had brought them there, and thestrange nature of Don Quixote’s madness, and how they were waiting forhis squire, who had gone in search of him. Like the recollection of adream, the quarrel he had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio’smemory, and he described it to the others; but he was unable to saywhat the dispute was about.c29b.jpg (351K)Full SizeAt this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming fromSancho Panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was callingaloud to them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiriesabout Don Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to hisshirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his ladyDulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quitthat place and come to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he hadanswered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of herbeauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and ifthis went on, Sancho said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperoras in duty bound, or even an archbishop, which was the least he couldbe; for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to gethim away from there. The licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy,for they would fetch him away in spite of himself. He then toldCardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote,or at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that she couldplay the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as shehad there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they mighttrust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carryingout their scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, andknew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons ofknights-errant.“In that case,” said the curate, “there is nothing more required thanto set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itselfin our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door foryour relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.”Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of somerich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and anecklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in aninstant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and richlady. All this, and more, she said, she had taken from home in case ofneed, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it.They were all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, anddeclared Don Fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejectedsuch charms. But the one who admired her most was Sancho Panza, for itseemed to him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his lifehe had never seen such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate withgreat eagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she wanted inthese out-of-the-way quarters.“This fair lady, brother Sancho,” replied the curate, “is no less apersonage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdomof Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon ofhim, which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant hasdone her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master hasacquired far and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.”“A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!” said Sancho Panza at this;“especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury,and right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant yourworship speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed,he happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all againstphantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, señorlicentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to bean archbishop, for that is what I’m afraid of, your worship wouldrecommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he willbe disabled from taking archbishop’s orders, and will easily come intohis empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking overthe matter carefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not dofor me that my master should become an archbishop, because I am no goodfor the Church, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have awife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me tohold a place of profit under the Church, would be endless work; sothat, señor, it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once—foras yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.”“She is called the Princess Micomicona,” said the curate; “for as herkingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.”“There’s no doubt of that,” replied Sancho, “for I have known many totake their name and title from the place where they were born and callthemselves Pedro of Alcalá, Juan of Úbeda, and Diego of Valladolid; andit may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of takingthe names of their kingdoms.”“So it may,” said the curate; “and as for your master’s marrying, Iwill do all in my power towards it:” with which Sancho was as muchpleased as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what ahold the absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he hadevidently persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate’s mule, andthe barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now toldSancho to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to saythat he knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master’sbecoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them;neither the curate nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them;Cardenio lest he should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had withhim, and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence justyet, so they allowed the others to go on before them, while theythemselves followed slowly on foot. The curate did not forget toinstruct Dorothea how to act, but she said they might make their mindseasy, as everything would be done exactly as the books of chivalryrequired and described.c29c.jpg (286K)Full SizeThey had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered DonQuixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without hisarmour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho thatthat was Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barberfollowing her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his muleand came forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting withgreat ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote;and though he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed himin this fashion:“From this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until yourgoodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honourand renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolateand afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strongarm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound toaid the helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name,hath come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes.”“I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,” replied Don Quixote, “norwill I listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise fromthe earth.”“I will not rise, señor,” answered the afflicted damsel, “unless ofyour courtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.”“I grant and accord it,” said Don Quixote, “provided without detrimentor prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of myheart and freedom, it may be complied with.”“It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthylord,” said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close tohis master’s ear and said to him very softly, “Your worship may verysafely grant the boon she asks; it’s nothing at all; only to kill a biggiant; and she who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen ofthe great kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.”“Let her be who she may,” replied Don Quixote, “I will do what is mybounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what Ihave professed;” and turning to the damsel he said, “Let your greatbeauty rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.”“Then what I ask,” said the damsel, “is that your magnanimous personaccompany me at once whither I will conduct you, and that you promisenot to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged meof a traitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped mykingdom.”“I repeat that I grant it,” replied Don Quixote; “and so, lady, you mayfrom this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, andlet your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the helpof God and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to yourkingdom, and seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm,notwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and nowhands to the work, for in delay there is apt to be danger.”The distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands;but Don Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight,would by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her withgreat courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look toRocinante’s girths, and to arm him without a moment’s delay. Sanchotook down the armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, andhaving seen to the girths armed his master in a trice, who as soon ashe found himself in his armour exclaimed:“Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.”The barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide hislaughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their finescheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, andthe promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out incompliance with it, he rose and took his lady’s hand, and between themthey placed her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, andthe barber settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go onfoot, which made him feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the wantof him now. But he bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that hismaster had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming anemperor; for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess,and be king of Micomicon at least. The only thing that troubled him wasthe reflection that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, andthat the people they would give him for vassals would be all black; butfor this he soon found a remedy in his fancy, and said he to himself,“What is it to me if my vassals are blacks? What more have I to do thanmake a cargo of them and carry them to Spain, where I can sell them andget ready money for them, and with it buy some title or some office inwhich to live at ease all the days of my life? Not unless you go tosleep and haven’t the wit or skill to turn things to account and sellthree, six, or ten thousand vassals while you would be talking aboutit! By God I will stir them up, big and little, or as best I can, andlet them be ever so black I’ll turn them into white or yellow. Come,come, what a fool I am!” And so he jogged on, so occupied with histhoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the hardship oftravelling on foot.Cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes,not knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, whowas very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting theirpurpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cutoff Cardenio’s beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own hegave him a black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet,while Cardenio’s appearance was so different from what it had been thathe would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Havingeffected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they weredisguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road beforethem, for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did notallow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They thenposted themselves on the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, andas soon as Don Quixote and his companions emerged from it the curatebegan to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving torecognise him, and after having stared at him for some time he hastenedtowards him with open arms exclaiming, “A happy meeting with the mirrorof chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flowerand cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of thedistressed, the quintessence of knights-errant!” And so saying heclasped in his arms the knee of Don Quixote’s left leg. He, astonishedat the stranger’s words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, andat length recognised him, very much surprised to see him there, andmade great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would notallow, on which Don Quixote said, “Permit me, señor licentiate, for itis not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a personas your worship on foot.”“On no account will I allow it,” said the curate; “your mightiness mustremain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatestdeeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, anunworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunchesof one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, ifthey have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steedPegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor,Muzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema,a little distance from the great Complutum.”“Nor even that will I consent to, señor licentiate,” answered DonQuixote, “and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady theprincess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddleof his mule to your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast willbear it.”“It will, I am sure,” said the princess, “and I am sure, too, that Ineed not order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate toallow a Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.”“That he is,” said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered hissaddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; butunfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as ithappened a hired one, which is the same thing as sayingill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks inthe air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition inquest of Don Quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast orhead. As it was, they so took him by surprise that he came to theground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all hecould do when he found himself without it was to cover his face hastilywith both his hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. DonQuixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws orblood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:“By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off andplucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved offdesignedly.”The curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme,at once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where MasterNicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breasthad it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he saidwere a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see;and as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appearedwell bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyondmeasure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him that charm whenhe had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extendbeyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beardhad been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated,and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.“And so it is,” said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him onthe first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curateshould mount, and that the three should ride by turns until theyreached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.Three then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess,and the curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and SanchoPanza, Don Quixote said to the damsel:“Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing toyou;” but before she could answer the licentiate said:c29d.jpg (345K)Full Size“Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? Is itperchance towards that of Micomicon? It must be, or else I know littleabout kingdoms.”She, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer“Yes,” so she said “Yes, señor, my way lies towards that kingdom.”“In that case,” said the curate, “we must pass right through myvillage, and there your worship will take the road to Cartagena, whereyou will be able to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fairand the sea smooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years youmay come in sight of the great lake Meona, I mean Meotides, which islittle more than a hundred days’ journey this side of your highness’skingdom.”c29e.jpg (318K)Full Size“Your worship is mistaken, señor,” said she; “for it is not two yearssince I set out from it, and though I never had good weather,nevertheless I am here to behold what I so longed for, and that is mylord Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as Iset foot in Spain and impelled me to go in search of him, to commendmyself to his courtesy, and entrust the justice of my cause to themight of his invincible arm.”“Enough; no more praise,” said Don Quixote at this, “for I hate allflattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the kind isoffensive to my chaste ears. I will only say, señora, that whether ithas might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted toyour service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season,I would ask the señor licentiate to tell me what it is that has broughthim into these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I amfilled with amazement.”“I will answer that briefly,” replied the curate; “you must know then,Señor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and Iwere going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine whowent to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sumbut that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, whichis something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked byfour footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them theystripped off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a falseone, and even this young man here”—pointing to Cardenio—“theycompletely transformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in theneighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galleyslaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very same spot by aman of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards,he released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have beenout of his senses, or he must be as great a scoundrel as they, or someman without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep,the fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defraudedjustice, and opposed his king and lawful master, for he opposed hisjust commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirredup the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and,lastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gainto his body.” Sancho had told the curate and the barber of theadventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his masterhad achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most ofit to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colourat every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been theliberator of those worthy people. “These, then,” said the curate, “werethey who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not letthem go to the punishment they deserved.”c29f.jpg (53K)Full SizeCHAPTER XXX.WHICH TREATS OF ADDRESS DISPLAYED BY THE FAIR DOROTHEA, WITH OTHERMATTERS PLEASANT AND AMUSINGc30a.jpg (147K)Full SizeThe curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, “In faith,then, señor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it wasnot for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind whathe was about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as theywere all on the march there because they were special scoundrels.”“Blockhead!” said Don Quixote at this, “it is no business or concern ofknights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains,or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way andsuffer as they do because of their faults or because of theirmisfortunes. It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need ofhelp, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. Iencountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people,and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for therest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving thesacred dignity of the señor licentiate and his honoured person, I sayhe knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, andthis I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;” andso saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down hismorion; for the barber’s basin, which according to him was Mambrino’shelmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair thedamage done to it by the galley slaves.Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughlyunderstood Don Quixote’s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panzawere making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, onobserving his irritation, “Sir Knight, remember the boon you havepromised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in anyother adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if thelicentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by thatunconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or evenbitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word thattended towards disrespect of your worship.”“That I swear heartily,” said the curate, “and I would have evenplucked off a moustache.”“I will hold my peace, señora,” said Don Quixote, “and I will curb thenatural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peaceand quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for thisconsideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to doso, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what arethe persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I amto take vengeance on your behalf?”“That I will do with all my heart,” replied Dorothea, “if it will notbe wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.”“It will not be wearisome, señora,” said Don Quixote; to which Dorotheareplied, “Well, if that be so, give me your attention.” As soon as shesaid this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager tohear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent forherself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her ashis master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle,and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time tothink, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.“First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is—” and hereshe stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had givenher; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, andsaid, “It is no wonder, señora, that your highness should be confusedand embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for suchafflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory,so that they do not even remember their own names, as is the case nowwith your ladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the PrincessMicomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and withthis cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollectionall you may wish to tell us.”“That is the truth,” said the damsel; “but I think from this on I shallhave no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safeinto port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacriothe Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and becameaware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, wasto die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart thislife, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But allthis, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as hiscertain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great islandclose to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name—for it isaverred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, healways looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out ofmalignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at—that heknew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan conditionwould overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, notleaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoidall this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however,as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to amarriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for ithas never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him beever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead,and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to waitand attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, butthat I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished toavoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, forthere would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant’sdevilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers setout for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding acertain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over thewhole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, DonAzote or Don Gigote.”“‘Don Quixote,’ he must have said, señora,” observed Sancho at this,“otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”“That is it,” said Dorothea; “he said, moreover, that he would be tallof stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the leftshoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs likebristles.”On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, “Here, Sancho my son,bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knightthat sage king foretold.”“What does your worship want to strip for?” said Dorothea.“To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,” answered DonQuixote.“There is no occasion to strip,” said Sancho; “for I know your worshiphas just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the markof a strong man.”“That is enough,” said Dorothea, “for with friends we must not look tooclosely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on thebackbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it whereit may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit thetruth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commendingmyself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as thefeatures of his countenance correspond with those assigned to thisknight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in allLa Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard suchaccounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me he was thevery one I had come in search of.”“But how did you land at Osuna, señora,” asked Don Quixote, “when it isnot a seaport?”But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying,“The princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga thefirst place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.”“That is what I meant to say,” said Dorothea.“And that would be only natural,” said the curate. “Will your majestyplease proceed?”“There is no more to add,” said Dorothea, “save that in finding DonQuixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regardmyself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesyand magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying mewhithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him faceto face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him andrestore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this mustcome to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapientforetold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee orGreek characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predictedknight, after having cut the giant’s throat, should be disposed tomarry me I was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawfulwife, and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person.”“What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?” said Don Quixote at this.“Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already gota kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!”“On my oath it is so,” said Sancho; “and foul fortune to him who won’tmarry after slitting Señor Pandahilado’s windpipe! And then, howillfavoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!”And so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign ofextreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea’smule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to givehim her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queenand mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to seethe madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorotheatherefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in herkingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover andenjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them alllaughing again.“This, sirs,” continued Dorothea, “is my story; it only remains to tellyou that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I havenone left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in agreat tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I cameto land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the wholecourse of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed;and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as Iought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at thebeginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive thesufferers of their memory.”“They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,” saidDon Quixote, “however great and unexampled those which I shall endurein your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I havepromised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world untilI find myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty headI trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this—I willnot say good sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried awaymine”—(this he said between his teeth, and then continued), “and whenit has been cut off and you have been put in peaceful possession ofyour realm it shall be left to your own decision to dispose of yourperson as may be most pleasing to you; for so long as my memory isoccupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by her—Isay no more—it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplatemarriage, even with a Phœnix.”The last words of his master about not wanting to marry were sodisagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with greatirritation:“By my oath, Señor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; forhow can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exaltedprincess as this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind everystone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcineafairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so faras to say she does not come up to the shoe of this one here. A poorchance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your worshipgoes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil’sname, marry, marry, and take this kingdom that comes to hand withoutany trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or governor of aprovince, and for the rest let the devil take it all.”Don Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his ladyDulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without sayinganything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacksthat he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorotheacried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life onthe spot.“Do you think,” he said to him after a pause, “you scurvy clown, thatyou are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be alwaysoffending and I always pardoning? Don’t fancy it, impious scoundrel,for that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue goingagainst the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar,that were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm I shouldnot have strength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper’stongue, what think you has won this kingdom and cut off this giant’shead and made you a marquis (for all this I count as alreadyaccomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, employing my armas the instrument of her achievements? She fights in me and conquers inme, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and being to her. Owhoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raisedfrom the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and the return you makefor so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred itupon you!”Sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, andrising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behindDorothea’s palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:“Tell me, señor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this greatprincess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so,how can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Letyour worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got herhere as if showered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back tomy lady Dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who keptmistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if thetruth is to be told, I like them both; though I have never seen thelady Dulcinea.”“How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!” exclaimed Don Quixote;“hast thou not just now brought me a message from her?”“I mean,” said Sancho, “that I did not see her so much at my leisurethat I could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charmspiecemeal; but taken in the lump I like her.”“Now I forgive thee,” said Don Quixote; “and do thou forgive me theinjury I have done thee; for our first impulses are not in ourcontrol.”“That I see,” replied Sancho, “and with me the wish to speak is alwaysthe first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what Ihave on the tip of my tongue.”“For all that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “take heed of what thousayest, for the pitcher goes so often to the well—I need say no more tothee.”“Well, well,” said Sancho, “God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, andwill judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worshipin not doing it.”“That is enough,” said Dorothea; “run, Sancho, and kiss your lord’shand and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with yourpraise and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso,of whom I know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trustin God, for you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live likea prince.”Sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master’s hand, whichDon Quixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing assoon as he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as hehad questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discusswith him. Sancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance inadvance Don Quixote said to him, “Since thy return I have had noopportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy missionand the answer thou hast brought back, and now that chance has grantedus the time and opportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst giveme by such good news.”“Let your worship ask what you will,” answered Sancho, “for I shallfind a way out of all as I found a way in; but I implore you, señor,not to be so revengeful in future.”“Why dost thou say that, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.“I say it,” he returned, “because those blows just now were morebecause of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the othernight, than for what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love andreverence as I would a relic—though there is nothing of that abouther—merely as something belonging to your worship.”“Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“for it is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that,and thou knowest the common saying, ‘for a fresh sin a fresh penance.’”While this was going on they saw coming along the road they werefollowing a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to bea gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever hesaw asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines dePasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass,for it was, in fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escaperecognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, beingable to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if theywere his own. Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he didso he shouted to him, “Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure,release my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass,leave my delight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up whatis not thine.”There was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at thefirst one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off andgot clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing himhe said, “How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, mycomrade?” all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were ahuman being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed andcaressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came upand congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially,who told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the orderfor the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.While the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, thecurate observed to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, aswell in the story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance itbore to those of the books of chivalry. She said that she had manytimes amused herself reading them; but that she did not know thesituation of the provinces or seaports, and so she had said athaphazard that she had landed at Osuna.“So I saw,” said the curate, “and for that reason I made haste to saywhat I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strangething to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all thesefigments and lies, simply because they are in the style and manner ofthe absurdities of his books?”“So it is,” said Cardenio; “and so uncommon and unexampled, that wereone to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there beany wit keen enough to imagine it.”“But another strange thing about it,” said the curate, “is that, apartfrom the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connectionwith his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss themin a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clearand composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, noone would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly soundunderstanding.”While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued hiswith Sancho, saying:“Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tellme now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didstthou find Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her?What did she answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter?Who copied it out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems tothee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifyingto give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me ofit.”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “if the truth is to be told, nobody copied outthe letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.”“It is as thou sayest,” said Don Quixote, “for the notebook in which Iwrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure,which gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst doon finding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldstreturn from the place where thou didst first miss it.”“So I should have done,” said Sancho, “if I had not got it by heartwhen your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan,who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said inall the days of his life, though he had read many a letter ofexcommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.”“And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.“No, señor,” replied Sancho, “for as soon as I had repeated it, seeingthere was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if Irecollect any of it, it is that about ‘Scrubbing,’ I mean to say‘Sovereign Lady,’ and the end ‘Yours till death, the Knight of theRueful Countenance;’ and between these two I put into it more thanthree hundred ‘my souls’ and ‘my life’s’ and ‘my eyes.”c30e.jpg (13K)CHAPTER XXXI.OF THE DELECTABLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO PANZA, HISSQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTSc31a.jpg (151K)Full Size“All that is not unsatisfactory to me,” said Don Quixote. “Go on; thoudidst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thoudidst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in goldthread for this her enslaved knight.”“I did not,” said Sancho, “but I found her winnowing two bushels ofwheat in the yard of her house.”“Then depend upon it,” said Don Quixote, “the grains of that wheat werepearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was itwhite wheat or brown?”“It was neither, but red,” said Sancho.“Then I promise thee,” said Don Quixote, “that, winnowed by her hands,beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; whenthou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on herhead? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?”“When I went to give it to her,” replied Sancho, “she was hard at itswaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, andshe said to me, ‘Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for Icannot read it until I have done sifting all this.”“Discreet lady!” said Don Quixote; “that was in order to read it at herleisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in heroccupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask aboutme, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and letnot an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.”“She asked me nothing,” said Sancho; “but I told her how your worshipwas left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, inamong these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eatingbread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing yourfortune.”“In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,” said Don Quixote;“for rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my lifefor having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady asDulcinea del Toboso.”“And so lofty she is,” said Sancho, “that she overtops me by more thana hand’s-breadth.”“What! Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “didst thou measure with her?”“I measured in this way,” said Sancho; “going to help her to put a sackof wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I couldsee she stood more than a good palm over me.”“Well!” said Don Quixote, “and doth she not of a truth accompany andadorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But onething thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didstthou not perceive a Sabæan odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know notwhat, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, anexhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?”“All I can say is,” said Sancho, “that I did perceive a little odour,something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat withhard work.”“It could not be that,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must have beensuffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I knowwell what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily ofthe field, that dissolved amber.”“Maybe so,” replied Sancho; “there often comes from myself that sameodour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;but that’s no wonder, for one devil is like another.”“Well then,” continued Don Quixote, “now she has done sifting the cornand sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?”“As for the letter,” said Sancho, “she did not read it, for she saidshe could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up intosmall pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lesther secrets should become known in the village, and that what I hadtold her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and theextraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, tomake an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissedyour hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to writeto you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight ofthis present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done withcarrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unlesssomething else of greater importance should happen, for she had a greatdesire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her howyour worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I askedher if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me hehad, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galleyslaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.”“So far all goes well,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me what jewel wasit that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings ofme? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errantto give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of theirladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some richjewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.”“That is very likely,” said Sancho, “and a good custom it was, to mymind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem tobe the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because thatwas what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when Itook leave of her; and more by token it was sheep’s-milk cheese.”“She is generous in the extreme,” said Don Quixote, “and if she did notgive thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she hadnot one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter;I shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou whatamazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come throughthe air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go toEl Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from hereto there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician whois my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there isand must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), thatthis same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thyknowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errantsleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way ithappened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues awayfrom the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril,as they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in themountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or anotherknight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death;but when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on acloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who justbefore had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers himfrom death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters suppingvery much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other willhave been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by thecraft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiantknights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing thatthou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in sucha short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must havecarried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.”“That must have been it,” said Sancho, “for indeed Rocinante went likea gipsy’s ass with quicksilver in his ears.”“Quicksilver!” said Don Quixote, “aye and what is more, a legion ofdevils, folk that can travel and make others travel without beingweary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, whatthinkest thou I ought to do about my lady’s command to go and see her?For though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too thatI am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess thataccompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard formy word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire tosee my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise andthe glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what Ithink I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly theplace where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head,and establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith Ishall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom Ishall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay,for she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame;for all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life,comes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.”“Ah! what a sad state your worship’s brains are in!” said Sancho. “Tellme, señor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to letslip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as aportion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more thantwenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all thingsnecessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal andCastile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what youhave said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in thefirst village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiatewho will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to giveadvice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow inthe hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the goodto his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may notcome to him.”“Look here, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “If thou art advising me tomarry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may becomeking, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I havepromised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thydesires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it astipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry,they shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it uponwhomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thouhave me bestow it but upon thee?”“That is plain speaking,” said Sancho; “but let your worship take careto choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don’t like the life, I maybe able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;don’t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill thisgiant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me itwill be one of great honour and great profit.”“I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and Iwill take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going tosee Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or tothose who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, foras Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to beknown it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.”“Well then, if that be so,” said Sancho, “how is it that your worshipmakes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselvesbefore my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your nameto it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go mustperforce kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submitthemselves to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?”“O, how silly and simple thou art!” said Don Quixote; “seest thou not,Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must knowthat according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honourto a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughtsnever go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no otherreward for their great and true devotion than that she should bewilling to accept them as her knights.”“It is with that kind of love,” said Sancho, “I have heard preacherssay we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being movedby the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, Iwould rather love and serve him for what he could do.”“The devil take thee for a clown!” said Don Quixote, “and what shrewdthings thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.”“In faith, then, I cannot even read.”Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wantedto halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drewup, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this timeweary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching himtripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of ElToboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put onthe clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and thoughthey were not very good, they were far better than those he put off.They dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what thecurate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though notvery well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passingon his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the nextmoment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began toweep freely, saying, “O, señor, do you not know me? Look at me well; Iam that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where Iwas tied.”Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to thosepresent and said: “That your worships may see how important it is tohave knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done bytyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some daysago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as ofa person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by mybounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to meto proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands beforeyou, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permitme to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied toan oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards foundto be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of hismare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel aflagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he washis servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather fromdishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, ‘Señor, he flogs meonly because I ask for my wages.’ The master made I know not whatspeeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did notaccept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear hewould take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed intothe bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not markwith what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promisedto do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer withouthesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may seethat it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errantabroad.”“All that your worship has said is quite true,” answered the lad; “butthe end of the business turned out just the opposite of what yourworship supposes.”“How! the opposite?” said Don Quixote; “did not the clown pay theethen?”“Not only did he not pay me,” replied the lad, “but as soon as yourworship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me upagain to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like aflayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed upwith some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, andbut for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things hesaid. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been untilnow in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascallyclown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; forif you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call foryou, nor meddled in other people’s affairs, my master would have beencontent with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have thenloosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused himso out of measure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger waskindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he sawyou had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel asif I should never be a man again.”“The mischief,” said Don Quixote, “lay in my going away; for I shouldnot have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have knownwell by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his wordif he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest,Andres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him,and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale’s belly.”“That is true,” said Andres; “but it was of no use.”“Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,” said Don Quixote; andso saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who wasbrowsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant todo. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastisehim for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the lastmaravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. Towhich she replied that he must remember that in accordance with hispromise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concludedhers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrainhis ardour until his return from her kingdom.“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and Andres must have patience untilmy return as you say, señora; but I once more swear and promise not tostop until I have seen him avenged and paid.”“I have no faith in those oaths,” said Andres; “I would rather have nowsomething to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in theworld; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, giveit me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and maytheir errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.”Sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese,and giving them to the lad he said, “Here, take this, brother Andres,for we have all of us a share in your misfortune.”“Why, what share have you got?”“This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,” answered Sancho; “andGod knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for Iwould have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have tobear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other thingsmore easily felt than told.”Andres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave himanything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the sayingis. However, before leaving he said, “For the love of God, sirknight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see themcutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to mymisfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come tome by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errantthat have ever been born God send his curse.”Don Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels atsuch a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightilychapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres’ story, and the others had to takegreat care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely outof countenance.c31e.jpg (32K)CHAPTER XXXII.WHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE’S PARTY AT THE INNc32a.jpg (132K)Full SizeTheir dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and withoutany adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, theobject of Sancho Panza’s fear and dread; but though he would haverather not entered it, there was no help for it. The landlady, thelandlord, their daughter, and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote andSancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of heartysatisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, andbade them make up a better bed for him than the last time: to which thelandlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time shewould give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote said he would, so theymade up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and helay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep.No sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at thebarber, and seizing him by the beard, said:“By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer;you must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing ofmy husband’s goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that Iused to stick in my good tail.”But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until thelicentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no furtheroccasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself andappear in his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled tothis inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should heask for the princess’s squire, they could tell him that she had senthim on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that shewas coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On thisthe barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at thesame time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effectDon Quixote’s deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck withastonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figureof the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare asthere was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment,served them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote wasasleep, and they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping wouldnow do him more good than eating.While at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife,their daughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed thestrange craze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found;and the landlady told them what had taken place between him and thecarrier; and then, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when shesaw he was not, she gave them the whole story of his blanketing, whichthey received with no little amusement. But on the curate observingthat it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that hadturned his brain, the landlord said:“I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there isno better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them,with other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but ofplenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here onholidays, and there is always one among them who can read and who takesup one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us,and stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs growyoung again. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of whatfurious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with thelonging to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them nightand day.”“And I just as much,” said the landlady, “because I never have a quietmoment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading;for then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget toscold.”“That is true,” said Maritornes; “and, faith, I relish hearing thesethings greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when theydescribe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under theorange trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half deadwith envy and fright; all this I say is as good as honey.”“And you, what do you think, young lady?” said the curate turning tothe landlord’s daughter.“I don’t know indeed, señor,” said she; “I listen too, and to tell thetruth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is notthe blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knightsutter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed theysometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them.”“Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?”said Dorothea.“I don’t know what I should do,” said the girl; “I only know that thereare some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigersand lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don’t know whatsort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather thanbestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. Idon’t know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour’ssake, why not marry them? That’s all they want.”“Hush, child,” said the landlady; “it seems to me thou knowest a greatdeal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk somuch.”“As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,” said thegirl.“Well then,” said the curate, “bring me these books, señor landlord,for I should like to see them.”“With all my heart,” said he, and going into his own room he broughtout an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which thecurate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in avery good hand. The first that he opened he found to be “Don Cirongilioof Thrace,” and the second “Don Felixmarte of Hircania,” and the otherthe “History of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, withthe Life of Diego García de Paredes.”When the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barberand said, “We want my friend’s housekeeper and niece here now.”“Nay,” said the barber, “I can do just as well to carry them to theyard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.”“What! your worship would burn my books!” said the landlord.“Only these two,” said the curate, “Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.”“Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burnthem?” said the landlord.“Schismatics you mean, friend,” said the barber, “not phlegmatics.”“That’s it,” said the landlord; “but if you want to burn any, let it bethat about the Great Captain and that Diego García; for I would ratherhave a child of mine burnt than either of the others.”“Brother,” said the curate, “those two books are made up of lies, andare full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a truehistory, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who byhis many and great achievements earned the title all over the world ofthe Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by himalone; and this Diego García de Paredes was a distinguished knight ofthe city of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and ofsuch bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel infull motion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridgehe kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achievedsuch other exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself withthe modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some freeand unbiased writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into theshade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.”c32b.jpg (395K)Full Size“Tell that to my father,” said the landlord. “There’s a thing to beastonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should readwhat I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one singlebackstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if theyhad been made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make;and another time he attacked a very great and powerful army, in whichthere were more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armedfrom head to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks ofsheep.”c32c.jpg (341K)Full Size“And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that wasso stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related thatas he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of thewater against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flunghimself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezedits throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding hewas throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to thebottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let gohis hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palacesand gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpentchanged itself into an old ancient man, who told him such things aswere never heard. Hold your peace, señor; for if you were to hear thisyou would go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captainand your Diego García!”Hearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, “Our landlord isalmost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.”“I think so,” said Cardenio, “for, as he shows, he accepts it as acertainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as itis written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would notpersuade him to the contrary.”“But consider, brother,” said the curate once more, “there never wasany Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace,or any of the other knights of the same sort, that the books ofchivalry talk of; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention ofidle wits, devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguilingthe time, as your reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in allseriousness there never were any such knights in the world, and no suchexploits or nonsense ever happened anywhere.”“Try that bone on another dog,” said the landlord; “as if I did notknow how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don’t think tofeed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for yourworship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say isnonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of theRoyal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot oflies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantmentsthat they take away one’s senses.”“I have told you, friend,” said the curate, “that this is done todivert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess,fives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do notcare, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kindare allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is thetruth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for truestories; and if it were permitted me now, and the present companydesired it, I could say something about the qualities books of chivalryshould possess to be good ones, that would be to the advantage and evento the taste of some; but I hope the time will come when I cancommunicate my ideas to someone who may be able to mend matters; and inthe meantime, señor landlord, believe what I have said, and take yourbooks, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and muchgood may they do you; and God grant you may not fall lame of the samefoot your guest Don Quixote halts on.”“No fear of that,” returned the landlord; “I shall not be so mad as tomake a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things arenot now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famousknights roamed about the world.”Sancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, andhe was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said aboutknights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalrybeing folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see whatcame of this journey of his master’s, and if it did not turn out ashappily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go backto his wife and children and his ordinary labour.The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curatesaid to him, “Wait; I want to see what those papers are that arewritten in such a good hand.” The landlord taking them out handed themto him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheetsof manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of“Novel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.” The curate read three or fourlines to himself, and said, “I must say the title of this novel doesnot seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.” Towhich the landlord replied, “Then your reverence will do well to readit, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have beenmuch pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but Iwould not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot thevalise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some timeor other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean toreturn them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.”“You are very right, friend,” said the curate; “but for all that, ifthe novel pleases me you must let me copy it.”“With all my heart,” replied the host.While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun toread it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he beggedhim to read it so that they might all hear it.“I would read it,” said the curate, “if the time would not be betterspent in sleeping.”“It will be rest enough for me,” said Dorothea, “to while away the timeby listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enoughto let me sleep when it would be seasonable.”“Well then, in that case,” said the curate, “I will read it, if it wereonly out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.”Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sanchotoo; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all,and receive it himself, the curate said, “Well then, attend to meeveryone, for the novel begins thus.”c32e.jpg (11K)CHAPTER XXXIII.IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF “THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY”In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province calledTuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo andLothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they werecalled by all that knew them “The Two Friends.” They were unmarried,young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough toaccount for the reciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it istrue, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love thanLothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; buton occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those ofLothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall in with those ofAnselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with theother with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could notsurpass it.Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of thesame city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimableherself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario,without whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and didso, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting thenegotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a shorttime he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla sohappy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanksunceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortunehad fallen to her. The first few days, those of a wedding being usuallydays of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend Anselmo’s house ashe had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the occasion, andto gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days wereover and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, hebegan purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for itseemed to him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends’houses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequencyas in their masters’ bachelor days: because, though true and genuinefriendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still amarried man’s honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liableto injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked thecessation of Lothario’s visits, and complained of it to him, sayingthat if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying hissociety as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by thethorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelorthey had earned such a sweet name as that of “The Two Friends,” heshould not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through aneedless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if sucha phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of hishouse and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wifeCamilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he wouldwish her to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one anothershe was grieved to see such coldness in him.To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade himto come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lotharioreplied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo wassatisfied of his friend’s good intentions, and it was agreed that ontwo days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dinewith him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lotharioresolved to observe it no further than he considered to be inaccordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more tohim than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whomheaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully whatfriends he brought to his house as what female friends his wifeassociated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in themarket-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations(opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may beeasily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whommost confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married manshould have some friend who would point out to him any negligence hemight be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen thatowing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he doesnot caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do ornot to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter ofhonour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easilycorrect if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be foundas Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true?Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with theutmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, andstrove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for goingto his house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a youngman, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious ofpossessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should beregarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of theidle public. For though his integrity and reputation might bridleslanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to hazard either his owngood name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of the daysagreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended wasunavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up withcomplaints on one side and excuses on the other. It happened, however,that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside thecity, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario.“Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to givesufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me theson of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggardhand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune,and above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend andCamilla for a wife—two treasures that I value, if not as highly as Iought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these goodthings, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to livehappily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the wholeworld; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed andoppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder atmyself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifleit and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than ifI were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; andas, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping,feeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friendto afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distressit causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the samedegree as my own folly has caused me misery.”The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as hewas to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though hestrove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend,his conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxietywhich this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing aflagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitousmethods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knewhe might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help incarrying them into effect.“That is the truth,” replied Anselmo, “and relying upon that I willtell thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is thatof knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I thinkher to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this pointexcept by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purityof her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded,my friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or isnot tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to thepromises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for whatthanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to bebad, and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whomno opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husbandthat will take her life the first time he detects her in animpropriety? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fearor want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out oftemptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasonsand many others that I could give thee to justify and support theopinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass thiscrisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooedand by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out,as I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon mygood fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of mydesire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says ‘Whoshall find her?’ has fallen to my lot. And if the result be thecontrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I havebeen right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain whichmy so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothingof all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep mefrom carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, thatthou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting thispurpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities tothat end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary forthe pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.And among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task tothee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee theconquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to accountthat accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone;thus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and mywrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I knowwell will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thouwilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly norslothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, andwith the loyalty our friendship assures me of.”Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to themwith such attention that, except to say what has been alreadymentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished. Thenperceiving that he had no more to say, after regarding him for a while,as one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder andamazement, he said to him, “I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo myfriend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thoughtthat thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to goso far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening tothee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do notknow thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest thatI am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not theAnselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario Ishould be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those ofthat Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou demandest of mewhat should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest. True friends willprove their friends and make use of them, as a poet has said, _usque adaras;_ whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendshipin things that are contrary to God’s will. If this, then, was aheathen’s feeling about friendship, how much more should it be aChristian’s, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for thesake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as toput aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, itshould not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but insuch as affect the friend’s life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, inwhich of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself togratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as Iunderstand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and torob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour itis plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse thandead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so muchwrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, andconsequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be notimpatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching theobject of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee toreply and for me to hear.”“Be it so,” said Anselmo, “say what thou wilt.”Lothario then went on to say, “It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine isjust now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who cannever be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from theHoly Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of theunderstanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must haveexamples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, notadmitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot bedenied, like, ‘_If equals be taken from equals, the remainders areequal:_’ and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed theydo not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before theireyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of thetruth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall haveto adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is soabsurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, thatI feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thysimplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I ameven tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thypernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allowme to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me fromdealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say,Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modestwoman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that ispure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told meso. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous,pure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thoubelievest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacks—asdoubtless she would—what higher titles than those she possesses nowdost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then, or in what will she bebetter then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her to be whatthou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou dostnot hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to prove herinstead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best tothee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is anuncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, aftertrial, it will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, itis conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather thanadvantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds,more especially when they are things which we are not forced orcompelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainlymadness to attempt them.“Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sakeof the world, or for both; those undertaken for God’s sake are thosewhich the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives ofangels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world arethose of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such avariety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what arecalled the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake ofGod and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no soonerdo they see in the enemy’s wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball couldmake, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding themanifest peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire ofdefending their faith, their country, and their king, they flingthemselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deathsthat await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, andthere is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full ofdifficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thywish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God northe blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue beas thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or morehonoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt bereduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will availthee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that hasbefallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thouknowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, letme repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo atthe end of the first part of his ‘Tears of Saint Peter,’ which saysthus:The anguish and the shame but greater grew    In Peter’s heart as morning slowly came;No eye was there to see him, well he knew,    Yet he himself was to himself a shame;Exposed to all men’s gaze, or screened from view,    A noble heart will feel the pang the same;A prey to shame the sinning soul will be,Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see.Thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but ratherthou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears ofblood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poettells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,better advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fictionit contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.Moreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see thegreat error thou wouldst commit.“Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master andlawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellenceand purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had beensatisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity,quality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind couldpossibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowingnothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire totake that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and bymere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and asfine as they said? And if thou didst, and if the stone should resist sosilly a test, that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and ifit were broken, as it might be, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly itwould, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in the opinion of all.Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of thefinest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and thatit is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; forif she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she nowpossesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist, bethink theenow how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good reason thouwilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin andthine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as achaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consistsin reputation; and since thy wife’s is of that high excellence thatthou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth inquestion? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, andthat impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip andfall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of allobstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely toattain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.Naturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a furof purest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they makeuse of this artifice. Having ascertained the places which it frequentsand passes, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it,drive it towards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mudit halts, and allows itself to be taken captive rather than passthrough the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which it valuesmore than life and liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine,and whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he whowishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt acourse different from that employed with the ermine; he must not putbefore her the mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers,because perhaps—and even without a perhaps—she may not have sufficientvirtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread underfoot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness ofvirtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A virtuouswoman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to betarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She must betreated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protected andprized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses andflowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck ablossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron gratingthey may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat tothee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy,and it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing. Aprudent old man was giving advice to another, the father of a younggirl, to lock her up, watch over her and keep her in seclusion, andamong other arguments he used these:Woman is a thing of glass;    But her brittleness ’tis best    Not too curiously to test:Who knows what may come to pass?Breaking is an easy matter,    And it’s folly to expose    What you cannot mend to blows;What you can’t make whole to shatter.This, then, all may hold as true,    And the reason’s plain to see;    For if Danaës there be,There are golden showers too.“All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference towhat concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of whatregards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth intowhich thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricatethee makes it necessary.“Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, athing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aimat this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thouwouldst rob me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay courtto her as thou requirest, she will certainly regard me as a man withouthonour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposedto what I owe to my own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldsthave me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that Ipress my suit upon her, will suppose that I have perceived in hersomething light that has encouraged me to make known to her my basedesire; and if she holds herself dishonoured, her dishonour touchesthee as belonging to her; and hence arises what so commonly takesplace, that the husband of the adulterous woman, though he may not beaware of or have given any cause for his wife’s failure in her duty, or(being careless or negligent) have had it in his power to prevent hisdishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name,and in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by allwho know of his wife’s guilt, though they see that he is unfortunatenot by his own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I willtell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of theunchaste wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, norhave done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be notweary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good.“When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the HolyScripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept tooka rib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and whenAdam awoke and beheld her he said, ‘This is flesh of my flesh, and boneof my bone.’ And God said ‘For this shall a man leave his father andhis mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was institutedthe divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone canloose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculoussacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh;and even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though theyhave two souls they have but one will. And hence it follows that as theflesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband thestains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon thehusband’s flesh, though he, as has been said, may have given no causefor them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is feltby the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels the hurtto the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being one withher, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour ordishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife’s is of thatkind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be helddishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou artencountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse uppassions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thouwilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words toexpress it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thyvile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonourand misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thyfriendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.”Having said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, andAnselmo, troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a whileto utter a word in reply; but at length he said, “I have listened,Lothario my friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hastchosen to say to me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons Ihave seen that high intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfectionof true friendship thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confessthat if I am not guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flyingfrom the good and pursuing the evil. This being so, thou must rememberthat I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimessuffer from, when the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster,charcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, much more toeat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice tocure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make abeginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, topay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her virtue willgive way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall restsatisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee todo, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard myhonour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that,being, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee topermit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honourthou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand ashigh as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art payingcourt to her, that is of little or no importance, because ere long, onfinding in her that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her theplain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in heresteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canstafford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even iffurther difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said,if thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issuedecided.”Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowingwhat further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order todissuade him from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide hispernicious scheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved togratify him and do what he asked, intending to manage the business soas to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so inreply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, for hewould undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as hepleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thankedhim for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; andit was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmoaffording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone withCamilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels to offer and presentto her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her to music, and writeverses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take the trouble ofcomposing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario agreed to allwith an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed, and withthis understanding they returned to Anselmo’s house, where they foundCamilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was laterthan usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own house,and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was troubledin mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advisedbusiness. That night, however, he thought of a plan by which he mightdeceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The next day he went todine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received andtreated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection her husbandfelt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo toldLothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to some pressingbusiness, as he would return in an hour and a half. Camilla begged himnot to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing couldpersuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remainwaiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss withhim. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone untilhe came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on thereason, or the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspectedit was a pretence.Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone atthe table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothariosaw himself in the lists according to his friend’s wish, and facing anenemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armedknights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did wasto lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand,and, asking Camilla’s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished totake a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said hecould repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair,and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, andthere he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who findingCamilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he hadstayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough forconversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lotharioshould wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as tohis success. Everything fell out as he wished; Lothario awoke, and thetwo at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what he was anxious toknow, and Lothario in answer told him that he had not thought itadvisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and therefore hadonly extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all the cityspoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to him anexcellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render herdisposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availinghimself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceiveone who is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transformshimself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming,discloses himself at length, and effects his purpose if at thebeginning his wiles are not discovered. All this gave greatsatisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would afford the sameopportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he would findthings to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot.Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a wordto Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that hehad never been able to draw from her the slightest indication ofconsent to anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope;on the contrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.“So far well,” said Anselmo; “Camilla has thus far resisted words; wemust now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow twothousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as manymore to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becominglyattired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they arebeautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists thistemptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble.”Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on theundertaking to the end, though he perceived he was to come out of itwearied and vanquished. The next day he received the four thousandcrowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he knew not whatto say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind totell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises asagainst words, and that there was no use in taking any further trouble,for the time was all spent to no purpose.But chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it thatAnselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listenthrough the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that formore than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, norwould utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he cameto the conclusion that what his friend had told him about the repliesof Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it wereso, he came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he hadand in what humour Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was notdisposed to go on with the business, for she had answered him soangrily and harshly that he had no heart to say anything more to her.“Ah, Lothario, Lothario,” said Anselmo, “how ill dost thou meet thyobligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I havebeen just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thouhast not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the formeroccasions thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as nodoubt it is, why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou bycraft to deprive me of the means I might find of attaining my desire?”Anselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario withshame and confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched byhaving been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from thatmoment devote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as hewould see if he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take thetrouble, for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove allsuspicions from his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him anopportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he resolved toabsent himself from his house for eight days, betaking himself to thatof a friend of his who lived in a village not far from the city; and,the better to account for his departure to Camilla, he so arranged itthat the friend should send him a very pressing invitation.Unhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thouplotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working againstthyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thywife Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness,no one assails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the wallsof thy house, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes,the fulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures herwill, making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven’s. If, then,the mine of her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee withoutlabour all the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wiltthou dig the earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure,risking the collapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props ofher weak nature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilitiesthat which is possible may with justice be withheld, as was betterexpressed by a poet who said:’Tis mine to seek for life in death,    Health in disease seek I,I seek in prison freedom’s breath,    In traitors loyalty.So Fate that ever scorns to grant    Or grace or boon to me,Since what can never be I want,    Denies me what might be.The next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leavinginstructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would cometo look after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to treathim as she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet andright-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, andbade him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupyhis seat at the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from notfeeling confidence that she would be able to manage his house, let himtry her this time, and he would find by experience that she was equalto greater responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasureto have it so, and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla saidshe would do so, though against her will.Anselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he wasreceived by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she neversuffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by hermen and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela byname, to whom she was much attached (for they had been brought uptogether from childhood in her father’s house), and whom she had keptwith her after her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothariodid not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removedthe cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such wereCamilla’s orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier thanCamilla and never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughtsfixed upon other things more to her taste, and wanting that time andopportunity for her own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress’scommands, but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had orderedher to do so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of hercountenance, the composure of her aspect were enough to bridle thetongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many virtues of Camillaexerted in imposing silence on Lothario’s tongue proved mischievous forboth of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts were busy, andcould dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla’s goodness andbeauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, notto say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might havebeen speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was;and thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance toAnselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the cityand going where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. Butalready the delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held himfast. He put a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel andrepress the pleasure he found in contemplating Camilla; when alone heblamed himself for his weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a badChristian; then he argued the matter and compared himself with Anselmo;always coming to the conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmohad been worse than his faithlessness, and that if he could excuse hisintentions as easily before God as with man, he had no reason to fearany punishment for his offence.In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with theopportunity which the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrewthe loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the objecttowards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been threedays absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual strugglewith his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so muchvehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed withamazement, and could only rise from her place and retire to her roomwithout answering him a word. But the hope which always springs up withlove was not weakened in Lothario by this repelling demeanour; on thecontrary his passion for Camilla increased, and she discovering in himwhat she had never expected, knew not what to do; and considering itneither safe nor right to give him the chance or opportunity ofspeaking to her again, she resolved to send, as she did that verynight, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in which sheaddressed the following words to him.CHAPTER XXXIV.IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF “THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY”“It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and acastle without its castellan, and I say that a young married womanlooks still worse without her husband unless there are very goodreasons for it. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and soincapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly Ishall have to go for relief to my parents’ house, even if I leave yourswithout a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deservedthat title, has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to whatconcerns you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more toyou, nor indeed is it fitting I should say more.”Anselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario hadalready begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as hewould have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence hesent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he wouldvery shortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo’s reply, whichplaced her in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared toremain in her own house, nor yet to go to her parents’; for inremaining her virtue was imperilled, and in going she was opposing herhusband’s commands. Finally she decided upon what was the worse coursefor her, to remain, resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario,that she might not give food for gossip to her servants; and she nowbegan to regret having written as she had to her husband, fearing hemight imagine that Lothario had perceived in her some lightness whichhad impelled him to lay aside the respect he owed her; but confident ofher rectitude she put her trust in God and in her own virtuousintentions, with which she hoped to resist in silence all thesolicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to her husband so asnot to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she even began toconsider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should ask her whatit was that induced her to write that letter. With these resolutions,more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the next daylistening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously thatCamilla’s firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do tocome to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of acertain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario hadawakened in her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed himall the more. In short he felt that while Anselmo’s absence affordedtime and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so heassailed her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there isnothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fairwomen’s vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In factwith the utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity withsuch engines that had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. Hewept, he entreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, hepretended with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that heoverthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he leastexpected and most longed for. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but whatwonder if the friendship of Lothario could not stand firm? A clearproof to us that the passion of love is to be conquered only by flyingfrom it, and that no one should engage in a struggle with an enemy somighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome his human power.Leonela alone knew of her mistress’s weakness, for the two falsefriends and new lovers were unable to conceal it. Lothario did not careto tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he hadafforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest sheshould undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and withoutintending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her.A few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceivewhat it had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highlyprized. He went at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; theyembraced each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life orhis death.“The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,” said Lothario,“are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern andcrown of all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her wereborne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presentshave been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned intoopen ridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so isshe the treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modestyabide with all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, andhappiness upon a woman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, andI have had no need to touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields notto things so base as gifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, andrefrain from making further proof; and as thou hast passed dryshodthrough the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may beentertained of women, seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean ofnew embarrassments, or with another pilot make trial of the goodnessand strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passageacross the sea of this world; but reckon thyself now safe in port, moorthyself with the anchor of sound reflection, and rest in peace untilthou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth canescape paying.”Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believedthem as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless hebegged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for thesake of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not makeuse of the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to dowas to write some verses to her, praising her under the name ofChloris, for he himself would give her to understand that he was inlove with a lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to singher praises with the decorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario wereunwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would composethem himself.“That will not be necessary,” said Lothario, “for the muses are notsuch enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the courseof the year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about apretended amour of mine; as for the verses I will make them, and if notas good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I canproduce.” An agreement to this effect was made between the friends, theill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his houseasked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not askedbefore—what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had senthim. Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked ather somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but that nowshe was undeceived and believed it to have been only her ownimagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being alone withher. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of thatsuspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rankin the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that evenif he were not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no roomfor fear. Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand byLothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he himselfhad told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utteranceto the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would have fallen intothe despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she received thestartling news without uneasiness.The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario torecite something of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; foras Camilla did not know her, he might safely say what he liked.“Even did she know her,” returned Lothario, “I would hide nothing, forwhen a lover praises his lady’s beauty, and charges her with cruelty,he casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can sayis that yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris,which goes thus:SONNETAt midnight, in the silence, when the eyesOf happier mortals balmy slumbers close,The weary tale of my unnumbered woesTo Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.And when the light of day returning dyesThe portals of the east with tints of rose,With undiminished force my sorrow flowsIn broken accents and in burning sighs.And when the sun ascends his star-girt throne,And on the earth pours down his midday beams,Noon but renews my wailing and my tears;And with the night again goes up my moan.Yet ever in my agony it seemsTo me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.”The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised itand said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return forsincerity so manifest. On which Camilla said, “Then all thatlove-smitten poets say is true?”“As poets they do not tell the truth,” replied Lothario; “but as loversthey are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.”“There is no doubt of that,” observed Anselmo, anxious to support anduphold Lothario’s ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of hisdesign as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight inanything that was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings hadher for their object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, sheasked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any.“I do,” replied Lothario, “but I do not think it as good as the firstone, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge,for it is this.SONNETI know that I am doomed; death is to meAs certain as that thou, ungrateful fair,Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ereMy heart repented of its love for thee.If buried in oblivion I should be,Bereft of life, fame, favour, even thereIt would be found that I thy image bearDeep graven in my breast for all to see.This like some holy relic do I prizeTo save me from the fate my truth entails,Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.Alas for him that under lowering skies,In peril o’er a trackless ocean sails,Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.”Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first;and so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he wasbinding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario wasdoing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thuseach step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement,she mounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fairfame.It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with hermaid, Camilla said to her, “I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, howlightly I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchaseby at least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that Iso quickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will thinkill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistibleinfluence he brought to bear upon me.”“Let not that trouble you, my lady,” said Leonela, “for it does nottake away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious togive it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized;nay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.”“They say also,” said Camilla, “that what costs little is valued less.”“That saying does not hold good in your case,” replied Leonela, “forlove, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; withthis one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others itburns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of itsdesires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morningit will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, forthere is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, whatdo you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love havingchosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you? andit was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolvedupon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by hispresence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no betteragent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; and of opportunityhe avails himself in all his feats, especially at the outset. All thisI know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and some day,señora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh andblood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself oryield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario’s whole soul in hiseyes, in his sighs, in his words, his promises and his gifts, and by itand his good qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love. This,then, being the case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideastrouble your imagination, but be assured that Lothario prizes you asyou do him, and rest content and satisfied that as you are caught inthe noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has taken you, andone that has not only the four S’s that they say true lovers ought tohave, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how Ican repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking, Amiable, Brave,Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, Illustrious,Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the S’saccording to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suithim, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealousfor your honour.”Camilla laughed at her maid’s alphabet, and perceived her to be moreexperienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted,confessing to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man ofgood birth of the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lestit might prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whetherher intrigue had gone beyond words, and she with little shame and mucheffrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies’ imprudences makeservants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a falsestep, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being known.All that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing abouther doings to him whom she called her lover, and to conduct her ownaffairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo orof Lothario. Leonela said she would, but kept her word in such a waythat she confirmed Camilla’s apprehension of losing her reputationthrough her means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as sheperceived that her mistress’s demeanour was not what it was wont to be,had the audacity to introduce her lover into the house, confident thateven if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him; for thesins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they makethemselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to hidetheir laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, whothough she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was withher lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chideher, but afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed alldifficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable,however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he salliedforth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at firsttook him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away,muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully andcautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, whichwould have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It didnot occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such anuntimely hour from Anselmo’s house could have entered it on Leonela’saccount, nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela;all he thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding withhim, so she had been with another; for this further penalty the erringwoman’s sin brings with it, that her honour is distrusted even by himto whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes herto have surrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit credenceto every suspicion that comes into his mind. All Lothario’s good senseseems to have failed him at this juncture; all his prudent maximsescaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally, and withoutmore ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous ragethat gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, whohad done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened to him andsaid to him, “Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have beenstruggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is nolonger possible or right that I should conceal from thee. Know thatCamilla’s fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will;and if I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order tosee if it were some light caprice of hers, or if she sought to try meand ascertain if the love I began to make to her with thy permissionwas made with a serious intention. I thought, too, that she, if shewere what she ought to be, and what we both believed her, would haveere this given thee information of my addresses; but seeing that shedelays, I believe the truth of the promise she has given me that thenext time thou art absent from the house she will grant me an interviewin the closet where thy jewels are kept (and it was true that Camillaused to meet him there); but I do not wish thee to rush precipitatelyto take vengeance, for the sin is as yet only committed in intention,and Camilla’s may change perhaps between this and the appointed time,and repentance spring up in its place. As hitherto thou hast alwaysfollowed my advice wholly or in part, follow and observe this that Iwill give thee now, so that, without mistake, and with maturedeliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem the bestcourse; pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou hastbeen wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in thecloset; for the tapestries and other things there afford greatfacilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine owneyes and I with mine what Camilla’s purpose may be. And if it be aguilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence,prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument ofpunishment for the wrong done thee.”Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words ofLothario, which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hearthem, for he now looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over thepretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory ofher victory. He remained silent for a considerable time, looking on theground with fixed gaze, and at length said, “Thou hast behaved,Lothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow thy advice ineverything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as thou seest itshould be kept in circumstances so unlooked for.”Lothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repentedaltogether of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he hadacted, as he might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some lesscruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned hishasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the mischiefor find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon revealingall to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so,he found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had the chanceof speaking to him, said, “Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I havea sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst;and it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of Leonela hasnow reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant ofhers in this house and remains with him till morning, at the expense ofmy reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who maysee him quitting my house at such unseasonable hours; but whatdistresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, for her privity toour intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers, while Iam dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.”As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device todelude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out wasLeonela’s lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept andsuffered, and begged him to help her, he became convinced of the truth,and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse; however, hetold Camilla not to distress herself, as he would take measures to puta stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time he told her what,driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and howhe had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there seeplainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreatedher pardon for this madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, andescape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence hadinvolved him. Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothariosaid, and with much anger, and great good sense, she reproved him andrebuked his base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution hehad made; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for goodand for evil, though it is apt to fail when she sets herselfdeliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the moment thought of away to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, and toldLothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himselfin the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to obtainthe means of their enjoying themselves for the future without anyapprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely shecharged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come toher when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answeras he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening.Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that he mightwith more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to beneedful.“I tell you,” said Camilla, “there is nothing to take care of except toanswer me what I shall ask you;” for she did not wish to explain to himbeforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling tofollow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should tryor devise some other less practicable plan.Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence ofgoing to his friend’s country house, took his departure, and thenreturned to conceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camillaand Leonela took care to give him the opportunity; and so he placedhimself in hiding in the state of agitation that it may be imagined hewould feel who expected to see the vitals of his honour laid barebefore his eyes, and found himself on the point of losing the supremeblessing he thought he possessed in his beloved Camilla. Having madesure of Anselmo’s being in his hiding-place, Camilla and Leonelaentered the closet, and the instant she set foot within it Camillasaid, with a deep sigh, “Ah! dear Leonela, would it not be better,before I do what I am unwilling you should know lest you should seek toprevent it, that you should take Anselmo’s dagger that I have asked ofyou and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? But no; there is noreason why I should suffer the punishment of another’s fault. I willfirst know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of Lothario haveseen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design sobase as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of myhonour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is inthe street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel itmay be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.”“Ah, señora,” said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, “what is ityou want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take yourown life, or Lothario’s? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead tothe loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissembleyour wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering thehouse now and finding us alone; consider, señora, we are weak women andhe is a man, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose,blind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours intoexecution he may do what will be worse for you than taking your life.Ill betide my master, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his houseto this shameless fellow! And supposing you kill him, señora, as Isuspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him when he is dead?”“What, my friend?” replied Camilla, “we shall leave him for Anselmo tobury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide hisown infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time Idelay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence againstthe loyalty I owe my husband.”Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla utteredmade him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved tokill Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself toavert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of aresolution so bold and virtuous he restrained himself, intending tocome forth in time to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla,throwing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, andLeonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, “Woe is me! that I shouldbe fated to have dying here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth,the crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!” with more to thesame effect, so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for themost tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and hermistress for another persecuted Penelope.Camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on comingto herself she said, “Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither thatfriend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or nightconcealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burnitself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for meltaway in menaces and maledictions.”“I am just going to call him, señora,” said Leonela; “but you mustfirst give me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means ofit give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives.”“Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,” said Camilla, “for rashand foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am notgoing to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herselfwithout having done anything wrong, and without having first killed himon whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die;but it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here toweep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.”Leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario,but at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued,as if speaking to herself, “Good God! would it not have been moreprudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before,than to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile,even for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt itwould have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour ofmy husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape fromthe strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor paywith his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the worldknow (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not onlypreserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man whodared to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose thisto Anselmo. But then I have called his attention to it in the letter Iwrote to him in the country, and, if he did nothing to prevent themischief I there pointed out to him, I suppose it was that from puregoodness of heart and trustfulness he would not and could not believethat any thought against his honour could harbour in the breast of sostanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself believe it for many days, norshould I have ever believed it if his insolence had not gone so far asto make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaselesstears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold determination stand in needof arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid!Let the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his life, andthen befall what may. Pure I came to him whom Heaven bestowed upon me,pure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed in my own chaste bloodand in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw inthe world;” and as she uttered these words she paced the room holdingthe unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, andsuch gestures that one would have supposed her to have lost her senses,and taken her for some violent desperado instead of a delicate woman.Anselmo, concealed behind some tapestries where he had hidden himself,beheld and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seenand heard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and hewould have been now well pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario’scoming were dispensed with, as he feared some sudden mishap; but as hewas on the point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace andundeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonela returning, leadingLothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line in front of heron the floor with the dagger, said to him, “Lothario, pay attention towhat I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this linethou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it thatsame instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in myhand; and before thou answerest me a word I desire thee to listen to afew from me, and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First,I desire thee to tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo,and in what light thou regardest him; and secondly I desire to know ifthou knowest me too. Answer me this, without embarrassment orreflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, for they are no riddles I putto thee.”Lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilladirected him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what sheintended to do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily andpromptly that between them they made the imposture look more true thantruth; so he answered her thus: “I did not think, fair Camilla, thatthou wert calling me to ask questions so remote from the object withwhich I come; but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doingso, thou mightst have put it off still longer, for the longing forhappiness gives the more distress the nearer comes the hope of gainingit; but lest thou shouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, Isay that I know thy husband Anselmo, and that we have known each otherfrom our earliest years; I will not speak of what thou too knowest, ofour friendship, that I may not compel myself to testify against thewrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors, makes me inflictupon him. Thee I know and hold in the same estimation as he does, forwere it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted in opposition to whatI owe to my station and the holy laws of true friendship, now brokenand violated by me through that powerful enemy, love.”“If thou dost confess that,” returned Camilla, “mortal enemy of allthat rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare tocome before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he isreflected on whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thouwrongest him? But, woe is me, I now comprehend what has made thee giveso little heed to what thou owest to thyself; it must have been somefreedom of mine, for I will not call it immodesty, as it did notproceed from any deliberate intention, but from some heedlessness suchas women are guilty of through inadvertence when they think they haveno occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, when did I by word orsign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow ofhope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy professions oflove sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When were thyfrequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt towin love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myselfthe blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of minehas all this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punishmyself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And thatthou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly beotherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of thesacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband,wronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by metoo through want of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have givenany, of encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I saythe suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engenderedthese lawless thoughts in thee, is what causes me most distress andwhat I desire most to punish with my own hands, for were any otherinstrument of punishment employed my error might become perhaps morewidely known; but before I do so, in my death I mean to inflict death,and take with me one that will fully satisfy my longing for the revengeI hope for and have; for I shall see, wheresoever it may be that I go,the penalty awarded by inflexible, unswerving justice on him who hasplaced me in a position so desperate.”As she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness sheflew upon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on buryingit in his breast that he was almost uncertain whether thesedemonstrations were real or feigned, for he was obliged to haverecourse to all his skill and strength to prevent her from strikinghim; and with such reality did she act this strange farce andmystification that, to give it a colour of truth, she determined tostain it with her own blood; for perceiving, or pretending, that shecould not wound Lothario, she said, “Fate, it seems, will not grant myjust desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be able to keep mefrom satisfying it partially at least;” and making an effort to freethe hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp, she releasedit, and directing the point to a place where it could not inflict adeep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close to theshoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in afaint.Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, andseeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood theywere still uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario,terrified and breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; butwhen he saw how slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears andonce more admired the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fairCamilla; and the better to support the part he had to play he began toutter profuse and doleful lamentations over her body as if she weredead, invoking maledictions not only on himself but also on him who hadbeen the means of placing him in such a position: and knowing that hisfriend Anselmo heard him he spoke in such a way as to make a listenerfeel much more pity for him than for Camilla, even though he supposedher dead. Leonela took her up in her arms and laid her on the bed,entreating Lothario to go in quest of someone to attend to her wound insecret, and at the same time asking his advice and opinion as to whatthey should say to Anselmo about his lady’s wound if he should chanceto return before it was healed. He replied they might say what theyliked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of anyuse; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he wasgoing where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance ofdeep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himselfalone, and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himselfunceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and theconsistent acting of Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo wouldbe that he had a second Portia for a wife, and he looked forwardanxiously to meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehoodand truth the most craftily veiled that could be imagined.Leonela, as he told her, stanched her lady’s blood, which was no morethan sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with alittle wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all thetime she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else hadbeen said before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he hadin Camilla a model of purity. To Leonela’s words Camilla added her own,calling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had notenough at the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the lifeshe so much loathed. She asked her attendant’s advice as to whether ornot she ought to inform her beloved husband of all that had happened,but the other bade her say nothing about it, as she would lay upon himthe obligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, which he could not dobut at great risk to himself; and it was the duty of a true wife not togive her husband provocation to quarrel, but, on the contrary, toremove it as far as possible from him.Camilla replied that she believed she was right and that she wouldfollow her advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how shewas to explain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it;to which Leonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie evenin jest.“How then can I know, my dear?” said Camilla, “for I should not dare toforge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can thinkof no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him theplain truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story.”“Be not uneasy, señora,” said Leonela; “between this and to-morrow Iwill think of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound beingwhere it is it can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleasedto aid us in a purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself,señora, and endeavour to calm your excitement lest my lord find youagitated; and leave the rest to my care and God’s, who always supportsgood intentions.”Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played outthe tragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted withsuch wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had becomethe realities of the parts they played. He longed for night and anopportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friendLothario, and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl hehad gained in having established his wife’s purity. Both mistress andmaid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away, and takingadvantage of it he made his escape, and at once went in quest ofLothario, and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced himwhen he found him, and the things he said to him in the joy of hisheart, and the praises he bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothariolistened to without being able to show any pleasure, for he could notforget how deceived his friend was, and how dishonourably he hadwronged him; and though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad,still he imagined it was only because he had left Camilla wounded andhad been himself the cause of it; and so among other things he told himnot to be distressed about Camilla’s accident, for, as they had agreedto hide it from him, the wound was evidently trifling; and that beingso, he had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be of good cheerand rejoice with him, seeing that by his means and adroitness he foundhimself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he could haveventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than making versesin praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time to come.Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid himin raising a monument so glorious.And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there couldbe in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrumentof his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utterdestruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with avertedcountenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carriedon for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned herwheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealedwas published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of hisill-advised curiosity.CHAPTER XXXV.WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITHCERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF “THE ILL-ADVISEDCURIOSITY” TO A CLOSEThere remained but little more of the novel to be read, when SanchoPanza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixotewas lying, shouting, “Run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is inthe thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. Bythe living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady thePrincess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean offas if it were a turnip.”“What are you talking about, brother?” said the curate, pausing as hewas about to read the remainder of the novel. “Are you in your senses,Sancho? How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is twothousand leagues away?”Here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shoutingout, “Stand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thyscimitar shall not avail thee!” And then it seemed as though he wereslashing vigorously at the wall.“Don’t stop to listen,” said Sancho, “but go in and part them or helpmy master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giantis dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life;for I saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off andfallen on one side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.”“May I die,” said the landlord at this, “if Don Quixote or Don Devilhas not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full athis bed’s head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takesfor blood;” and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him,and there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world.He was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover histhighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs werevery long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on hishead he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, roundhis left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, forreasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand heheld his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on allsides, uttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting somegiant: and the best of it was his eyes were not open, for he was fastasleep, and dreaming that he was doing battle with the giant. For hisimagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going toaccomplish, that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdomof Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believinghe was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to theskins that the whole room was full of wine. On seeing this the landlordwas so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fistbegan to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate hadnot dragged him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to anend. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barberbrought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with onedash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not socompletely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing howshort and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battlebetween her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searchingall over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it hesaid, “I see now that it’s all enchantment in this house; for the lasttime, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumpswithout knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; andnow this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut offwith my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from afountain.”“What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and hissaints?” said the landlord. “Don’t you see, you thief, that the bloodand the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed andthe red wine swimming all over the room?—and I wish I saw the soul ofhim that stabbed them swimming in hell.”“I know nothing about that,” said Sancho; “all I know is it will be mybad luck that through not finding this head my county will melt awaylike salt in water;”—for Sancho awake was worse than his master asleep,so much had his master’s promises addled his wits.The landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and themischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like thelast time when they went without paying; and that their privileges ofchivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them offwithout paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be putto the damaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote’s hands,who, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence ofthe Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, “Exalted andbeauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless ofany harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth amreleased from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on highand by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilledit so successfully.”“Did not I say so?” said Sancho on hearing this. “You see I wasn’tdrunk; there you see my master has already salted the giant; there’s nodoubt about the bulls; my county is all right!”Who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, masterand man? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursedhimself; but at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrivedwith no small trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleepwith every appearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep,and came out to the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on nothaving found the head of the giant; but much more work had they toappease the landlord, who was furious at the sudden death of hiswine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half crying, “At anevil moment and in an unlucky hour he came into my house, thisknight-errant—would that I had never set eyes on him, for dear he hascost me; the last time he went off with the overnight score against himfor supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his squire and ahack and an ass, saying he was a knight adventurer—God send unluckyadventures to him and all the adventurers in the world—and thereforenot bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantrytariff: and then, all because of him, came the other gentleman andcarried off my tail, and gives it back more than two cuartillos theworse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for my husband’spurpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my wine-skinsand spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let him notdeceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of mymother, they shall pay me down every quarto; or my name is not what itis, and I am not my father’s daughter.” All this and more to the sameeffect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maidMaritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiledfrom time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to makegood all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded thewine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of thetail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, tellinghim that she pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain thathis master had decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefullyestablished in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county therewas in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princessshe might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and moreby token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it wasnot to be seen now it was because everything that happened in thathouse went by enchantment, as he himself had proved the last time hehad lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he neednot be uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished. Alltherefore being appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with thenovel, as he saw there was but little more left to read. Dorothea andthe others begged him to finish it, and he, as he was willing to pleasethem, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued the tale in thesewords:The result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla’svirtue, he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposelylooked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelingstowards him to be the opposite of what they were; and the better tosupport the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to thehouse, as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his presence wasplain to be seen. But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no accountallow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author ofhis own dishonour, while he believed he was insuring his happiness.Meanwhile the satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered tocarry on her amour reached such a height that, regardless of everythingelse, she followed her inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confidentthat her mistress would screen her, and even show her how to manage itsafely. At last one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela’s room,and on trying to enter to see who it was, he found that the door washeld against him, which made him all the more determined to open it;and exerting his strength he forced it open, and entered the room intime to see a man leaping through the window into the street. He ranquickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was unable toeffect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him crying, “Becalm, señor; do not give way to passion or follow him who has escapedfrom this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.”Anselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger andthreatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would killher. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, “Donot kill me, señor, for I can tell you things more important than anyyou can imagine.”“Tell me then at once or thou diest,” said Anselmo.“It would be impossible for me now,” said Leonela, “I am so agitated:leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fillyou with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through thewindow is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise tobecome my husband.”Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time sheasked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla,so satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room,and left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out untilshe had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once tosee Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between himand her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform himmatters of serious importance.There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for sogreat was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had goodreason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of herfaithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if hersuspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thoughtthat Anselmo was asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she hadand some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from thehouse and betook herself to Lothario’s, to whom she related what hadoccurred, imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or flywith her where they might be safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexityto which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to uttera word in reply, still less to decide upon what he should do. At lengthhe resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his wasprioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which thecircumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left herthere, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know ofhis departure.As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from hisside, rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened tothe room where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, butfound no Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, aplain proof that she had let herself down from it and escaped. Hereturned, uneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed oranywhere in the house he was lost in amazement. He asked the servantsof the house about her, but none of them could give him anyexplanation. As he was going in search of Camilla it happened by chancethat he observed her boxes were lying open, and that the greater partof her jewels were gone; and now he became fully aware of his disgrace,and that Leonela was not the cause of his misfortune; and, just as hewas, without delaying to dress himself completely, he repaired, sad atheart and dejected, to his friend Lothario to make known his sorrow tohim; but when he failed to find him and the servants reported that hehad been absent from his house all night and had taken with him all themoney he had, he felt as though he were losing his senses; and to makeall complete on returning to his own house he found it deserted andempty, not one of all his servants, male or female, remaining in it. Heknew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to bedeserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and sawhimself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned,he felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of hishonour, for in Camilla’s disappearance he saw his own ruin. After longreflection he resolved at last to go to his friend’s village, where hehad been staying when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance ofthis complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of his house,mounted his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his journey; buthe had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he hadto dismount and tie his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threwhimself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there heremained till nearly nightfall, when he observed a man approaching onhorseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him, he asked what wasthe news in Florence.The citizen replied, “The strangest that have been heard for many aday; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of thewealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last nightCamilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this hasbeen told by a maid-servant of Camilla’s, whom the governor found lastnight lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo’s house.I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I knowis that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one couldhave expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimatefriendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that theywere called ‘The Two Friends.’”“Is it known at all,” said Anselmo, “what road Lothario and Camillatook?”“Not in the least,” said the citizen, “though the governor has beenvery active in searching for them.”“God speed you, señor,” said Anselmo.“God be with you,” said the citizen and went his way.This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of hissenses but of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reachedthe house of his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, butseeing him come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he wassuffering some heavy affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowedto retire to rest, and to be given writing materials. His wish wascomplied with and he was left lying down and alone, for he desiredthis, and even that the door should be locked. Finding himself alone heso took to heart the thought of his misfortune that by the signs ofdeath he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to a close,and therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of thecause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put downall he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life,a victim to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailedupon him. The master of the house observing that it was now late andthat Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if hisindisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his bodypartly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay withthe written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having firstcalled to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he wasdead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household towitness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read thepaper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and whichcontained these words:“A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news ofmy death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgiveher, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to haverequired her to perform them; and since I have been the author of myown dishonour, there is no reason why—”So far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,before he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. Thenext day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives,who had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the conventwhere Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband onthat inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death,but because of those she received of her lover’s departure. Althoughshe saw herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit theconvent or take the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligencereached her that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. deLautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain GonzaloFernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, whither her too laterepentant lover had repaired. On learning this Camilla took the veil,and shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. This wasthe end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning.“I like this novel,” said the curate; “but I cannot persuade myself ofits truth; and if it has been invented, the author’s invention isfaulty, for it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as totry such a costly experiment as Anselmo’s. If it had been representedas occurring between a gallant and his mistress it might pass; butbetween husband and wife there is something of an impossibility aboutit. As to the way in which the story is told, however, I have no faultto find.”CHAPTER XXXVI.WHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INNc36a.jpg (124K)Full SizeJust at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of theinn, exclaimed, “Here comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop herewe may say _gaudeamus_.”“What are they?” said Cardenio.“Four men,” said the landlord, “riding _à la jineta_, with lances andbucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman inwhite on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendantson foot.”“Are they very near?” said the curate.“So near,” answered the landlord, “that here they come.”Hearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into DonQuixote’s room, and they hardly had time to do so before the wholeparty the host had described entered the inn, and the four that were onhorseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, andcame forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, andone of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood atthe entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All thistime neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word,only on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and lether arms fall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on footthen led the horses away to the stable. Observing this the curate,curious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving suchsilence were, went to where the servants were standing and put thequestion to one of them, who answered him.“Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem tobe people of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the ladyyou saw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show himrespect, and nothing is done except what he directs and orders.”“And the lady, who is she?” asked the curate.“That I cannot tell you either,” said the servant, “for I have not seenher face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and uttersuch groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but itis no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as mycomrade and I have only been in their company two days, for having metus on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them toAndalusia, promising to pay us well.”“And have you heard any of them called by his name?” asked the curate.“No, indeed,” replied the servant; “they all preserve a marvelloussilence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them exceptthe poor lady’s sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feelsure that wherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and asfar as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is morelikely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vowsis not of her own free will, that she is so unhappy as she seems tobe.”“That may well be,” said the curate, and leaving them he returned towhere Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by naturalcompassion drew near to her and said, “What are you suffering from,señora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how torelieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.”To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeatedher offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentlemanwith the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest,approached and said to Dorothea, “Do not give yourself the trouble,señora, of making any offers to that woman, for it is her way to giveno thanks for anything that is done for her; and do not try to make heranswer unless you want to hear some lie from her lips.”“I have never told a lie,” was the immediate reply of her who had beensilent until now; “on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful andso ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition;and this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truththat has made you false and a liar.”Cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close tothe speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote’s room betweenthem, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,“Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached myears?” Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeingthe speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observingwhich the gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step.In her agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she hadcovered her face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparableand marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning hereyes, everywhere she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that madeher look as if she had lost her senses, and so marked that it excitedthe pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew not whatcaused it. The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and beingso fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand tohis veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, andDorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes sawthat he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. Theinstant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn fromthe depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for thebarber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallencompletely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover herface and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he itwas who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as ifdeath-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp ofLuscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself fromhis hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognisedher. Cardenio also heard Dorothea’s cry as she fell fainting, andimagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from theroom, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in hisarms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three,Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcelyknowing what had happened to them.They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando,Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda atCardenio. The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressedDon Fernando: “Leave me, Señor Don Fernando, for the sake of what youowe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to clingto the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neitheryour importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your giftshave been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hiddenfrom our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; andwell you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be ableto efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, leadyou, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, youraffection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it upin the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it maybe by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to thelast moment of life.”Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda’s words,by means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernandodid not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution aswell as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood ofbright and touching tears addressed him thus:“If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thinearms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seenby this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilthave it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowlypeasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldstraise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusionof innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thyimportunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she openedthe gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of herliberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shownby my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thyappearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, Iwould not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame;it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee thathave led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so followthy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not helpbeing mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bearthee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thouwouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda’s because thouart mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio’s; and it willbe easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, thanto lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst addressthyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wertnot ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly tothy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, andif it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art agentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happyat last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what Iam, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,for so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Donot by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in thestreets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyalservices they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are notdeserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thyblood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or nonobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that inillustrious lineages it is not the woman’s blood that is of account;and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou artwanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even Ihave higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, señor, theseare my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thywife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, ifthou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me;witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, whichthou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; andif all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up itssilent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth ofwhat I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.”All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnestfeeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with DonFernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listenedto her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to suchsobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was notsoftened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding herwith no less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for herintelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her to say some wordsof comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando’s grasp which heldher fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, afterregarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms,and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:“Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it isimpossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so manytruths.”Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the groundwhen Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, havingretreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear asideand regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, andsaid as he clasped her in his arms, “If Heaven in its compassion iswilling to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant,and fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms thatnow receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me tocall thee mine.”At these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning torecognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes thatit was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of allconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck andpressing her face close to his, said, “Yes, my dear lord, you are thetrue master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interposeagain, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.”A strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fanciedthat Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to takevengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;and the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness sheclasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as toprevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, “Whatis it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thouhast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wifeis in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right forthee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven hasdone, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to bethy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth andconstancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love theface and bosom of her lawful husband. For God’s sake I entreat of thee,for thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thyanger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live inpeace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heavenpermits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thylofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason hasmore influence than passion.”All the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscindain his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if hesaw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resistas best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost himhis life. But now Don Fernando’s friends, as well as the curate and thebarber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthySancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreatinghim to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer herreasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed,what she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it wasnot, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition ofProvidence that they had all met in a place where no one could haveexpected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only deathcould part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were toseparate them they would think their death most happy; and that in acase that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conqueringand putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and ofhis own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven hadgranted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty ofDorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excelher; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and thesurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded himthat if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, hecould not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doingso he would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, whoknow and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one ofhumble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itselfto the level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it uponan equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway ofpassion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, heis not to be blamed who gives way to it.To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that DonFernando’s manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, wastouched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, hecould not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of thegood advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down andembracing Dorothea, saying to her, “Rise, dear lady, it is not rightthat what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and ifuntil now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been byHeaven’s decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you loveme, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you isthat you reproach me not with my transgression and grievouswrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make youmine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this,turn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will seein them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gainedthe object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies allmy wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy yearswith her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to livewith my Dorothea;” and with these words he once more embraced her andpressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to takegreat heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love andrepentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, andalmost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their ownhappiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed aheavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping;though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea wasnot as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such greatfavours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, andthen Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before DonFernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them inlanguage so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raisingthem up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy.He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so farremoved from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all thatshe had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and hiscompanions were so delighted that they wished the story had beenlonger; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When shehad finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the cityafter he had found in Luscinda’s bosom the paper in which she declaredthat she was Cardenio’s wife, and never could be his. He said he meantto kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by herparents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, andresolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity shouldoffer. The next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from herfather’s house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone.Finally, at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in aconvent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she werenot to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this,taking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the placewhere she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it wereknown he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent;and watching a time when the porter’s lodge was open he left two toguard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest ofLuscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one ofthe nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, theyreached a place with her where they provided themselves with what theyrequired for taking her away; all which they were able to do incomplete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerabledistance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself inhis power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herselfdid nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus insilence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reachingheaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.c36b.jpg (319K)Full Sizec36e.jpg (36K)CHAPTER XXXVII.IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITHOTHER DROLL ADVENTURESc37a.jpg (159K)Full SizeTo all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see howhis hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and howthe fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giantinto Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totallyunconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable topersuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream;Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda’s thoughts ran inthe same direction. Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favourshown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinthin which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good nameand of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full ofcontentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicatedand hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made soundreflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his goodfortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humourwas the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate hadgiven her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustainedthrough Don Quixote’s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was theonly one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a longface he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:“Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much asyou like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant orrestoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settlednow.”“I should think it was,” replied Don Quixote, “for I have had the mostprodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever rememberhaving had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke—swish!—Ibrought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forthfrom him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.”“Like red wine, your worship had better say,” replied Sancho; “for Iwould have you know, if you don’t know it, that the dead giant is ahacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red winethat it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that boreme; and the devil take it all.”“What art thou talking about, fool?” said Don Quixote; “art thou in thysenses?”“Let your worship get up,” said Sancho, “and you will see the nicebusiness you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will seethe queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other thingsthat will astonish you, if you understand them.”“I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,” returned DonQuixote; “for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I toldthee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment,and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.”“I could believe all that,” replied Sancho, “if my blanketing was thesame sort of thing also; only it wasn’t, but real and genuine; for Isaw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanketand jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with asmuch laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowingpeople, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is noenchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and badluck.”“Well, well, God will give a remedy,” said Don Quixote; “hand me myclothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations andthings thou speakest of.”Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curategave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote’smadness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him fromthat Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of hislady’s scorn. He described to them also nearly all the adventures thatSancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little,thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazyintellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the ladyDorothea’s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with theirpurpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way ofgetting him home.Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggestedthat Luscinda would act and support Dorothea’s part sufficiently well.“No,” said Don Fernando, “that must not be, for I want Dorothea tofollow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman’s village isnot very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for hisrelief.”“It is not more than two days’ journey from this,” said the curate.“Even if it were more,” said Don Fernando, “I would gladly travel sofar for the sake of doing so good a work.”At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino’shelmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, andleaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filledDon Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his leanyellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and thesolemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what hewould say, and he, fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed herwith great gravity and composure:“I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness hasbeen annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and ladyof high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a privatemaiden. If this has been done by the command of the magician king yourfather, through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need andare entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know halfthe mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if hehad read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as Ihave, he would have found at every turn that knights of less renownthan mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no greatmatter to kill a whelp of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for itis not many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and—I will notspeak of it, that they may not say I am lying; time, however, thatreveals all, will tell the tale when we least expect it.”“You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,” saidthe landlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue andon no account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, “I say inconclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your father has broughtabout this metamorphosis in your person for the reason I havementioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there isno peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way, and withit, before many days are over, I will bring your enemy’s head to theground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom.”Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, whoaware of Don Fernando’s determination to carry on the deception untilDon Quixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of mannerand gravity made answer, “Whoever told you, valiant Knight of theRueful Countenance, that I had undergone any change or transformationdid not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It istrue that certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more thanI could have hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have nottherefore ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the samedesire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of yourvaliant and invincible arm. And so, señor, let your goodness reinstatethe father that begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that hewas a wise and prudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sureand easy way of remedying my misfortune; for I believe, señor, that hadit not been for you I should never have lit upon the good fortune I nowpossess; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true; as most ofthese gentlemen who are present can fully testify. All that remains isto set out on our journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make muchway; and for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, Itrust to God and the valour of your heart.”So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turnedto Sancho, and said to him, with an angry air, “I declare now, littleSancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief andvagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had beenturned into a maiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I ampersuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, andother nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I have ever beenin all my life? I vow” (and here he looked to heaven and ground histeeth) “I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way thatwill teach sense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errantin the world.”“Let your worship be calm, señor,” returned Sancho, “for it may well bethat I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princessMicomicona; but as to the giant’s head, or at least as to the piercingof the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, assure as there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the headof your worship’s bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if notyou will see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worshipthe landlord calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartilyglad that her ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me asmuch as anyone.”“I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,” said Don Quixote;“forgive me, and that will do.”“That will do,” said Don Fernando; “let us say no more about it; and asher ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it istoo late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasantconversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Señor Don Quixote;for we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he isabout to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he hasundertaken.”“It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,” said Don Quixote; “andI am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and thegood opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or itshall cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.”Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passedbetween Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an endby a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed fromhis attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors,for he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth withhalf-sleeves and without a collar; his breeches were also of bluecloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins andhad a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast. Behindhim, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in Moorishfashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and wearing alittle brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her shouldersto her feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, inage a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with longmoustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his appearance was suchthat if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a personof quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a room, and whenthey told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed, andapproaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he took her downfrom the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, herdaughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirelynew costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man whohad brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, “Donot be put out, señora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here,for it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if youwill be pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda)perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of yourjourney.”To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from herseat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bendingher body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence theyconcluded that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christiantongue.At this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwiseengaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and thatshe made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, “Ladies, thisdamsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that ofher own country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer whathas been asked of her.”“Nothing has been asked of her,” returned Luscinda; “she has only beenoffered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters weoccupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstancesallow, with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that standin need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service isrendered.”“On her part and my own, señora,” replied the captive, “I kiss yourhands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered,which, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance,is, it is plain to see, a very great one.”“Tell me, señor,” said Dorothea, “is this lady a Christian or a Moor?for her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what wecould wish she was not.”“In dress and outwardly,” said he, “she is a Moor, but at heart she isa thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to becomeone.”“Then she has not been baptised?” returned Luscinda.“There has been no opportunity for that,” replied the captive, “sinceshe left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the presentshe has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as tomake it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in allthe ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, erelong she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which ishigher than her dress or mine indicates.”By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know whothe Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask justthen, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to restthemselves than for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea tookthe Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself,requested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if toask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her inArabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon sheremoved it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea sheseemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautifulthan Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty couldcompare with theirs it was the Moorish lady’s, and there were eventhose who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as itis the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and securegood-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention tothe lovely Moor.Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied thatit was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed whatthe Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure andenergy, “No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!” giving them to understand thatshe was called “Maria” and not “Zoraida.” These words, and the touchingearnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear fromsome of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by naturetender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately,saying, “Yes, yes, Maria, Maria,” to which the Moor replied, “Yes, yes,Maria; Zoraida macange,” which means “not Zoraida.”Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompaniedDon Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for themthe best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore havingarrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one,for round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat ofhonour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assignedto Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by hisside, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their placesnext her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next thecaptive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, thecurate and the barber. And so they supped in high enjoyment, which wasincreased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, movedby an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such lengthwhen he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them:“Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are thethings they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry.Say, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of thiscastle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose orimagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who isbeside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I amthat Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by themouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and callingsurpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the moredeserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the moreexposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have thepreeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, thatthey know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonlyassign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of themind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employmentto the body alone; as if the calling were a porter’s trade, for whichnothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we whoprofess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for theexecution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul ofthe warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under hiscare, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whetherby bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions ofthe enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward offimpending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in themthe body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of themind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, thatof the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and thiswill be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for thatpurpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object.The end and goal of letters—I am not speaking now of divine letters,the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with anend so infinite no other can be compared—I speak of human letters, theend of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every manthat which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed:an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but notsuch as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for theirend and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in thislife. The first good news the world and mankind received was that whichthe angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang inthe air, ‘Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men ofgood-will;’ and the salutation which the great Master of heaven andearth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered anyhouse, was to say, ‘Peace be on this house;’ and many other times hesaid to them, ‘My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace bewith you;’ a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: ajewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or inheaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another namefor arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, andthat so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn tothe bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of him who followsthe profession of arms, and see which are the greater.”Don Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in suchcorrect language, that for the time being he made it impossible for anyof his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they weremostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, theylistened to him with great pleasure as he continued: “Here, then, I sayis what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that allare poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I havesaid that he endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said abouthis hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good things oflife. This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, ornakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme butthat he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhatunseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatestmisery of the student is what they themselves call ‘going out forsoup,’ and there is always some neighbour’s brazier or hearth for them,which, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, andlastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not gointo other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and nosuperabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorgingthemselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated themto a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, roughand hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fallagain, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we haveseen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, asif borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, Isay, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger turnedinto satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fineraiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, thejustly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared withwhat the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short ofit, as I am now about to show.”c37e.jpg (13K)CHAPTER XXXVIII.WHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS ANDLETTERSc38a.jpg (180K)Full SizeContinuing his discourse Don Quixote said: “As we began in thestudent’s case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now ifthe soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself thereis no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comeslate or never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperillinghis life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so greatthat a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in thedepth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of theweather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of hismouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come outcold, contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward tothe approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bedthat awaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins bybeing over narrow, for he can easily measure out on the ground as helikes, and roll himself about in it to his heart’s content without anyfear of the sheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this,suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to havecome; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest himwith the doctor’s cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps,that has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm orleg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over himand keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same povertyhe was in before, and he must go through more engagements and morebattles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; butmiracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you haveever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by warfall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt youwill reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot benumbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up withthree figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters;for by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means ofsupport; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward ismuch less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier toreward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated bygiving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of theircalling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the veryproperty of the master they serve; but this impossibility onlystrengthens my argument.“Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for whichit is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority ofarms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the argumentsput forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letterssay that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too,has its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain ofletters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without themlaws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdomspreserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;and, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies,cities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence andconfusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free tomake use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain thatwhatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attainto eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness,headaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which Ihave already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary courseof things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, andin an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk oflosing his life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach orharass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who findshimself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelinor cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the postwhere he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or flyfrom the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to informhis captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by acounter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of themoment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend intothe deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let ussee whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleysstem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled onewith the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than twofeet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before himthreatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of thefoe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too thatwith the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profunditiesof Neptune’s bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour thatnerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, andstruggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy’s ship. And what isstill more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths hewill never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes hisplace; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like anenemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment’s pausebetween their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all thechances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dreadfury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I ampersuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention,by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the lifeof a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, inthe height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate bravehearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by onewho fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine,which in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the lifeof one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflecton this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of havingadopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as welive in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives mesome uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of theopportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the knownearth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven’swill be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the morehonoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant ofyore exposed themselves to.”All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the otherssupped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho morethan once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enoughafterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who hadheard him to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rationalviews on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, whenhis wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him hewas quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that hehimself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the sameopinion.They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while thehostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of LaMancha’s garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were tobe quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged thecaptive to tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to bestrange and interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on hisarrival in company with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that hewould very willingly yield to his request, only he feared his talewould not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not tobe wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate and the othersthanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself sopressed said there was no occasion to ask, where a command had suchweight, and added, “If your worships will give me your attention youwill hear a true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed withingenious and studied art cannot come up to.” These words made themsettle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence, and heseeing them waiting on his words in mute expectation, began thus in apleasant quiet voice.c38e.jpg (18K)CHAPTER XXXIX.WHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURESc39a.jpg (137K)Full SizeMy family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, andnature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though inthe general poverty of those communities my father passed for beingeven a rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been asclever in preserving his property as he was in spending it. Thistendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from havingbeen a soldier in his youth, for the soldier’s life is a school inwhich the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; andif any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters ofrare occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered onprodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married manwho has children to succeed to his name and position. My father hadthree, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make choice of aprofession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist his propensity,he resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of hisprodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without whichAlexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us allthree aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat tothe following effect:“My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or saidthan that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do notlove you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have noself-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned;therefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like afather, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to dowith you what I have for some time back meditated, and after maturedeliberation decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line oflife or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honourand profit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is todivide my property into four parts; three I will give to you, to eachhis portion without making any difference, and the other I will retainto live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life Heavenmay be pleased to grant me. But I wish each of you on taking possessionof the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shallindicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind verytrue—as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long practicalexperience—and the one I refer to says, ‘The church, or the sea, or theking’s house;’ as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants toflourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or go to sea,adopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king’s service in hishousehold, for they say, ‘Better a king’s crumb than a lord’s favour.’I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you shouldfollow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in thewars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service inhis household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers greatdistinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full sharesin money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in theend. Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice asI have laid it before you.”Having called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him notto strip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased, forwe were young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with hiswishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms andthereby serve God and my king. My second brother having made the sameproposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion thatfell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, saidhe would rather follow the church, or go to complete his studies atSalamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choiceof our professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time hementioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he hadgiven to each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousandducats apiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paidfor it down, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on thesame day took leave of our good father; and at the same time, as itseemed to me inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in hisold age, I induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats, as theremainder would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed. Mytwo brothers, moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, sothat there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money,besides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell to him whichhe preferred to retain in land instead of selling it. Finally, as Isaid, we took leave of him, and of our uncle whom I have mentioned, notwithout sorrow and tears on both sides, they charging us to let themknow whenever an opportunity offered how we fared, whether well or ill.We promised to do so, and when he had embraced us and given us hisblessing, one set out for Salamanca, the other for Seville, and I forAlicante, where I had heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in acargo of wool for Genoa.It is now some twenty-two years since I left my father’s house, and allthat time, though I have written several letters, I have had no newswhatever of him or of my brothers; my own adventures during that periodI will now relate briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa aftera prosperous voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I providedmyself with arms and a few soldier’s accoutrements; thence it was myintention to go and take service in Piedmont, but as I was already onthe road to Alessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke ofAlva was on his way to Flanders. I changed my plans, joined him, servedunder him in the campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of theCounts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famouscaptain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after myarrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope PiusV. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the commonenemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famousisland of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorableand disastrous. It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John ofAustria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming ascommander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of thevast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred myheart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign whichwas expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certainpromises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I shouldbe promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake myself,as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had justarrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetianfleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that Itook part in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be acaptain of infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck ratherthan my merits raised me; and that day—so fortunate for Christendom,because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the errorunder which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea—onthat day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken,among all that were there made happy (for the Christians who died thatday were happier than those who remained alive and victorious) I alonewas miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might haveexpected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed thatfamous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on myhands.It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring andsuccessful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltesegalley (only three knights being left alive in it, and they badlywounded), the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and mycompany were placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to doin such a case, I leaped on board the enemy’s galley, which, sheeringoff from that which had attacked it, prevented my men from followingme, and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were insuch numbers that I was unable to resist; in short I was taken, coveredwith wounds; El Uchali, as you know, sirs, made his escape with hisentire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in his power, the only sadbeing among so many filled with joy, and the only captive among so manyfree; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in theTurkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that day.They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made mymaster general at sea for having done his duty in the battle andcarried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order ofMalta. The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I foundmyself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the threelanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing thewhole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines andjanizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to beattacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, orshoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed,in so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered itotherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded onour side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God’swill and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishmentto chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is anisland near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of theharbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On this expeditionwas taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of thefamous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galleycalled the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that fatherof his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don Álvaro deBazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what tookplace at the capture of the Prize.The son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,that, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley wasbearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once droppedtheir oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the endof the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on frombench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that beforehe had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; sogreat, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and thehatred with which they hated him.We returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three,it became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdomfrom the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end tothe hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in theworld, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took theloss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess,he made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it thanhe was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Golettaand the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While allthese events were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without anyhope of freedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, forI was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of mymisfortunes. At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, beforewhich places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers,and more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts ofAfrica, and in the train of all this great host such munitions andengines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they mighthave covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The firstto fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell,not by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could andshould have done, but because experiment proved how easilyentrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used tobe found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards;and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works sohigh that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as iffrom a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintainthe defence.It was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves upin the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at thelanding-place; but those who say so talk at random and with littleknowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort therewere barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number,however resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers likethose of the enemy? And how is it possible to help losing a strongholdthat is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determinedenemies in their own country? But many thought, and I thought so too,that it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain inpermitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief,that devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wastedthere to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture bythe invincible Charles V.; as if to make that eternal, as it is andwill be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell;but the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defendedit fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killedin twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of threehundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear andmanifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily theyhad defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or towerwhich was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don JuanZanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated uponterms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of theGoletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and tookthe loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way toConstantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also tookthe commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanesegentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these twofortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as wasshown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John AndreaDoria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain bysome Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrustedhimself, and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor toTabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoeseemployed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carriedit to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truthof our Castilian proverb, that “though the treason may please, thetraitor is hated;” for they say he ordered those who brought him thepresent to be hanged for not having brought him alive.c39b.jpg (371K)Full SizeAmong the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedrode Aguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, whohad been ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rareintelligence, who had in particular a special gift for what they callpoetry. I say so because his fate brought him to my galley and to mybench, and made him a slave to the same master; and before we left theport this gentleman composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on theGoletta and the other on the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them,for I have them by heart, and I think they will be liked rather thandisliked.The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, DonFernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and whenhe came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, “Before your worshipproceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that DonPedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.”“All I know is,” replied the captive, “that after having been inConstantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, incompany with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not Icannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw theGreek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the resultof the journey was.”“Well then, you are right,” returned the gentleman, “for that Don Pedrois my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich,married, and with three children.”“Thanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,” said thecaptive; “for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare withrecovering lost liberty.”“And what is more,” said the gentleman, “I know the sonnets my brothermade.”“Then let your worship repeat them,” said the captive, “for you willrecite them better than I can.”“With all my heart,” said the gentleman; “that on the Goletta runsthus.”c39e.jpg (38K)CHAPTER XL.IN WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED.c40a.jpg (131K)Full SizeSONNET“Blest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free,In guerdon of brave deeds beatified,Above this lowly orb of ours abideMade heirs of heaven and immortality,With noble rage and ardour glowing yeYour strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied,And with your own blood and the foeman’s dyedThe sandy soil and the encircling sea.It was the ebbing life-blood first that failedThe weary arms; the stout hearts never quailed.Though vanquished, yet ye earned the victor’s crown:Though mourned, yet still triumphant was your fallFor there ye won, between the sword and wall,In Heaven glory and on earth renown.”“That is it exactly, according to my recollection,” said the captive.“Well then, that on the fort,” said the gentleman, “if my memory servesme, goes thus:SONNET“Up from this wasted soil, this shattered shell,Whose walls and towers here in ruin lie,Three thousand soldier souls took wing on high,In the bright mansions of the blest to dwell.The onslaught of the foeman to repelBy might of arm all vainly did they try,And when at length ’twas left them but to die,Wearied and few the last defenders fell.And this same arid soil hath ever beenA haunt of countless mournful memories,As well in our day as in days of yore.But never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween,From its hard bosom purer souls than these,Or braver bodies on its surface bore.”The sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at thetidings they gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he wenton to say:The Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gaveorders to dismantle the Goletta—for the fort was reduced to such astate that there was nothing left to level—and to do the work morequickly and easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were theyable to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong, that isto say, the old walls, while all that remained standing of the newfortifications that the Fratin had made came to the ground with thegreatest ease. Finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant toConstantinople, and a few months later died my master, El Uchali,otherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish “the scabby renegade;”for that he was; it is the practice with the Turks to name people fromsome defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there areamong them only four surnames belonging to families tracing theirdescent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, taketheir names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moralqualities. This “scabby one” rowed at the oar as a slave of the GrandSignor’s for fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, inresentment at having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turnedrenegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to revengehimself; and such was his valour that, without owing his advancement tothe base ways and means by which most favourites of the Grand Signorrise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwardsgeneral-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He wasa Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated hisslaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and afterhis death they were divided, as he directed by his will, between theGrand Signor (who is heir of all who die and shares with the childrenof the deceased) and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetianrenegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken byUchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his mostfavoured youths. He came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: hisname was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and became king of Algiers.With him I went there from Constantinople, rather glad to be so nearSpain, not that I intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot, butto try if fortune would be kinder to me in Algiers than inConstantinople, where I had attempted in a thousand ways to escapewithout ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in Algiers Iresolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose I cherishedso dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; andwhen in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer myexpectations, without giving way to despair I immediately began to lookout for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faint orfeeble it might be.In this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by theTurks a baño in which they confine the Christian captives, as wellthose that are the king’s as those belonging to private individuals,and also what they call those of the Almacen, which is as much as tosay the slaves of the municipality, who serve the city in the publicworks and other employments; but captives of this kind recover theirliberty with great difficulty, for, as they are public property andhave no particular master, there is no one with whom to treat for theirransom, even though they may have the means. To these baños, as I havesaid, some private individuals of the town are in the habit of bringingtheir captives, especially when they are to be ransomed; because therethey can keep them in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives.The king’s captives also, that are on ransom, do not go out to workwith the rest of the crew, unless when their ransom is delayed; forthen, to make them write for it more pressingly, they compel them towork and go for wood, which is no light labour.I, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered thatI was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want offortune, nothing could dissuade them from including me among thegentlemen and those waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me,more as a mark of this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life inthat baño with several other gentlemen and persons of quality markedout as held to ransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, wesuffered from hunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so muchas hearing and seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-ofcruelties my master inflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hangeda man, impaled one, cut off the ears of another; and all with so littleprovocation, or so entirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged hedid it merely for the sake of doing it, and because he was by naturemurderously disposed towards the whole human race. The only one thatfared at all well with him was a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedraby name, to whom he never gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to begiven, or addressed a hard word, although he had done things that willdwell in the memory of the people there for many a year, and all torecover his liberty; and for the least of the many things he did we alldreaded that he would be impaled, and he himself was in fear of it morethan once; and only that time does not allow, I could tell you nowsomething of what that soldier did, that would interest and astonishyou much more than the narration of my own tale.To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked bythe windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position;and these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes thanwindows, and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. Itso happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prisonwith three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far wecould leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the otherChristians had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and fromone of these little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a clothattached to the end of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving asif making signs to us to come and take it. We watched it, and one ofthose who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whetherthey would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he did so thereed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say“no” by a shake of the head. The Christian came back, and it was againlowered, making the same movements as before. Another of my comradeswent, and with him the same happened as with the first, and then thethird went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.Seeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I cameunder the reed it was dropped and fell inside the baño at my feet. Ihastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in thiswere ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors,and each worth ten reals of our money.It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was notless than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune couldhave come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness todrop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour wasintended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to theterrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put outthat opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fanciedthat it must be some woman living in that house that had done us thiskindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaamsafter the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, andcrossing the arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same windowa small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. Thissign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in thehouse, and that it was she who had been so good to us; but thewhiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made usdismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christianrenegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, andgladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In allour conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forwardour sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where thecross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at leastfifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or anyother sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains toascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there wereany Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything morethan that he who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, HadjiMorato by name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of high dignityamong them. But when we least thought it was going to rain any morecianis from that quarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with anothercloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, ason the former occasion, the baño was deserted and unoccupied.c40b.jpg (288K)Full SizeWe made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before Idid; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach itwas let drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crownswith a paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there wasa large cross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returnedto the terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, Imade signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed.We were all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place;and as none of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to knowwhat the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty of findingsomeone to read it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, anative of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and hadgiven pledges that bound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him;for it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return toChristian territory, to carry about them certificates from captives ofmark testifying, in whatever form they can, that such and such arenegade is a worthy man who has always shown kindness to Christians,and is anxious to escape on the first opportunity that may presentitself. Some obtain these testimonials with good intentions, others putthem to a cunning use; for when they go to pillage on Christianterritory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken prisoners, theyproduce their certificates and say that from these papers may be seenthe object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, andthat it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray. In thisway they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make theirpeace with the Church before it does them any harm, and then when theyhave the chance they return to Barbary to become what they were before.Others, however, there are who procure these papers and make use ofthem honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friend of mine, then,was one of these renegades that I have described; he had certificatesfrom all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour as stronglyas we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would haveburned him alive.I knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speakbut also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, Iasked him to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in ahole in my cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it andmuttering to himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understoodit, and he told me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him totell me its meaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that hemight do it more satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required,and he set about translating it bit by bit, and when he had done hesaid:“All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, andyou must bear in mind that when it says ‘Lela Marien’ it means ‘OurLady the Virgin Mary.’”We read the paper and it ran thus:“When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray theChristian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about LelaMarien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,but to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told meto go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had greatlove for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, butexcept thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young andbeautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canstcontrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husbandthere, and if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marienwill find me someone to marry me. I myself have written this: have acare to whom thou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are allperfidious. I am greatly troubled on this account, for I would not havethee confide in anyone, because if my father knew it he would at oncefling me down a well and cover me with stones. I will put a thread tothe reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou hast no one to write forthee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make meunderstand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I often kiss asthe captive bade me, protect thee.”Judge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words ofthis paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegadeperceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been inreality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what hesuspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he wouldrisk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from hisbreast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the imagerepresented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly andfaithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever wechose to reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by meansof her who had written that paper, he and all of us would obtain ourliberty, and he himself obtain the object he so much desired, hisrestoration to the bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by hisown sin and ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb. Therenegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance,that with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of thematter, and so we gave him a full account of all, without hidinganything from him. We pointed out to him the window at which the reedappeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and resolved toascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also that itwould be advisable to answer the Moorish lady’s letter, and therenegade without a moment’s delay took down the words I dictated tohim, which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing ofimportance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory, orever will while life lasts. This, then, was the answer returned to theMoorish lady:“The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is thetrue mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the landof the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she bepleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee,for she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of allthese Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can forthee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what thoudost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah hasgiven us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well,as thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canstinform us of all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thoudost reach the land of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give theemy promise upon it as a good Christian; and know that the Christianskeep their promises better than the Moors. Allah and Marien his motherwatch over thee, my Lady.”The paper being written and folded I waited two days until the baño wasempty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on theterrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not longin making its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could notdistinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach thethread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied thepaper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearancewith the white flag of peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and Ipicked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of allsorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened ourjoy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very night ourrenegade returned and said he had learned that the Moor we had beentold of lived in that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that hewas enormously rich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of allhis wealth, and that it was the general opinion throughout the citythat she was the most beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several ofthe viceroys who came there had sought her for a wife, but that she hadbeen always unwilling to marry; and he had learned, moreover, that shehad a Christian slave who was now dead; all which agreed with thecontents of the paper. We immediately took counsel with the renegade asto what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off theMoorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in the end itwas agreed that for the present we should wait for a secondcommunication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who nowdesires to be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no oneelse could find a way out of all these difficulties. When we haddecided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he wouldlose his life or restore us to liberty. For four days the baño wasfilled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearancefor four days, but at the end of that time, when the baño was, as itgenerally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that itpromised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I foundanother paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. Therenegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read,which was to this effect:“I cannot think of a plan, señor, for our going to Spain, nor has LelaMarien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done isfor me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With itransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land ofthe Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others;and he will find me in my father’s garden, which is at the Babazon gatenear the seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father andmy servants. You can carry me away from there by night without anydanger, and bring me to the vessel. And remember thou art to be myhusband, else I will pray to Marien to punish thee. If thou canst nottrust anyone to go for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for Iknow thou wilt return more surely than any other, as thou art agentleman and a Christian. Endeavour to make thyself acquainted withthe garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know that thebaño is empty and I will give thee abundance of money. Allah protectthee, señor.”These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearingthem, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, andpromised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too madethe same offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that hewould not on any account consent to one being set free before all wenttogether, as experience had taught him how ill those who have been setfree keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives ofdistinction frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom ofone who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him toarm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him, but whonever came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it againefface from the memory all the obligations in the world. And to provethe truth of what he said, he told us briefly what had happened to acertain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangestcase that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing andmarvellous things are happening every instant. In short, he ended bysaying that what could and ought to be done was to give the moneyintended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him, so that hemight with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence ofbecoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and whenmaster of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way ofgetting us all out of the baño and putting us on board; especially ifthe Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, becauseonce free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embarkeven in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do notallow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vesselfor going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyonewho buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants itfor the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however hecould get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with himin the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; andunder cover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which casehe looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and mycomrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,as the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearingthat if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us indanger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings withZoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We thereforeresolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade’s;and at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her thatwe would do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as ifLela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whetherwe were to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewedmy promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the bañochanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reedand cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said thatthe next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father’sgarden, but that before she went she would give us more money; and ifit were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us asmuch as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, andbesides she kept all the keys.We at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, andwith eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencianmerchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had mereleased on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first shipfrom Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money atonce it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had beenfor a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his ownadvantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to dealwith that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. TheThursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to thegarden she gave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of herdeparture, begging me, if I were ransomed, to find out her father’sgarden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going thereto see her. I answered in a few words that I would do so, and that shemust remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers thecaptive had taught her. This having been done, steps were taken toransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the baño, andlest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money wasforthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devilshould prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; forthough their position might be sufficient to relieve me from thisapprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in thematter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handingover all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety andconfidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangementand secret to him, which might have been dangerous.c40e.jpg (34K)CHAPTER XLI.IN WHICH THE CAPTIVE STILL CONTINUES HIS ADVENTURESc41a.jpg (106K)Full SizeBefore fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased anexcellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to makethe transaction safe and lend a colour to it, he thought it well tomake, as he did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leaguesfrom Algiers on the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade indried figs. Two or three times he made this voyage in company with theTagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins inBarbary, and those of Granada Mudéjares; but in the Kingdom of Fez theycall the Mudéjares Elches, and they are the people the king chieflyemploys in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel heanchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the gardenwhere Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with thetwo Moorish lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, eithergoing through his prayers, or else practising as a part what he meantto perform in earnest. And thus he would go to Zoraida’s garden and askfor fruit, which her father gave him, not knowing him; but though, ashe afterwards told me, he sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her whohe was, and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of theChristians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had neverbeen able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to beseen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: withChristian captives they permit freedom of intercourse andcommunication, even more than might be considered proper. But for mypart I should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps itmight have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. ButGod, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for ourrenegade’s well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how safely he could go toShershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he liked, andthat the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I wasransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me tolook out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and abovethose who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday,which he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelveSpaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave thecity; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, becausethere were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all therowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not thattheir master remained at home that summer without going to sea in orderto finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I saidnothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to comeout stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato’s garden, waitingfor me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately,with orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were notto say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at thatspot.This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary stephad to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood thatshe might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surpriseif we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought theChristians’ vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, to goto the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before mydeparture I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The firstperson I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that allover Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captivesand Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any othernation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can allunderstand one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked mewhat I wanted in his garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that Iwas a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew as a certainty that he was avery great friend of his), and that I wanted some herbs to make asalad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what mymaster demanded for me. While these questions and answers wereproceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some timebefore, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women areby no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians,or, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in comingto where her father stood with me; moreover her father, seeing herapproaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be beyond my powernow to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, thebrilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself beforemy eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung fromher fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head.On her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (forso bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, setwith so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valuedthem at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists wereworth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for thehighest display and adornment of the Moorish women is deckingthemselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there aretherefore more among the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida’sfather had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and thepurest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundredthousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, wasmistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have beenbeautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may beimagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for,as everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and itsseasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturallythe emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed morefrequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herselfbefore me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremelybeautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object Ihad ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I feltas though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring merelief and happiness.As she approached her father told her in his own language that I was acaptive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had comefor salad.She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I havespoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was notransomed.I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it mightbe seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousandfive hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, “Hadst thou been myfather’s, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee fortwice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves andmake yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.”“That may be, lady,” said I; “but indeed I dealt truthfully with mymaster, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.”“And when dost thou go?” said Zoraida.“To-morrow, I think,” said I, “for there is a vessel here from Francewhich sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.”“Would it not be better,” said Zoraida, “to wait for the arrival ofships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are notyour friends?”“No,” said I; “though if there were intelligence that a vessel were nowcoming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, itis more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel toreturn to my country and to those I love is so great that it will notallow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, ifit be delayed.”“No doubt thou art married in thine own country,” said Zoraida, “andfor that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.”“I am not married,” I replied, “but I have given my promise to marry onmy arrival there.”“And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?” said Zoraida.“So beautiful,” said I, “that, to describe her worthily and tell theethe truth, she is very like thee.”At this her father laughed very heartily and said, “By Allah,Christian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, whois the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her welland thou wilt see I am telling the truth.”Zoraida’s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most ofthese words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language,that, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning moreby signs than by words.While we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came runningup, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of thegarden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. Theold man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so tospeak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of thesoldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who areunder their power that they treat them worse than if they were theirslaves. Her father said to Zoraida, “Daughter, retire into the houseand shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou,Christian, pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safeto thy own country.”I bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone withZoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father badeher; but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden,turning to me with her eyes full of tears she said, “Tameji, cristiano,tameji?” that is to say, “Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?”I made answer, “Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be onthe watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seestus; for most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.”This I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passedbetween us, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeblesteps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it (and itmight have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise orderedit), just as we were moving on in the manner and position I havedescribed, with her arm round my neck, her father, as he returned afterhaving sent away the Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceivedthat he saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not toremove her arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closer to me andlaid her head on my breast, bending her knees a little and showing allthe signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seemas though I were supporting her against my will. Her father camerunning up to where we were, and seeing his daughter in this stateasked what was the matter with her; she, however, giving no answer, hesaid, “No doubt she has fainted in alarm at the entrance of thosedogs,” and taking her from mine he drew her to his own breast, whileshe sighing, her eyes still wet with tears, said again, “Ameji,cristiano, ameji”—“Go, Christian, go.” To this her father replied,“There is no need, daughter, for the Christian to go, for he has donethee no harm, and the Turks have now gone; feel no alarm, there isnothing to hurt thee, for as I say, the Turks at my request have goneback the way they came.”c41b.jpg (320K)Full Size“It was they who terrified her, as thou hast said, señor,” said I toher father; “but since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displeaseher: peace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to thisgarden for herbs if need be, for my master says there are nowherebetter herbs for salad than here.”“Come back for any thou hast need of,” replied Hadji Morato; “for mydaughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or anyChristian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or thatit was time for thee to look for thy herbs.”With this I at once took my leave of both; and she, looking as thoughher heart were breaking, retired with her father. While pretending tolook for herbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studiedcarefully all the approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of thehouse and everything that could be taken advantage of to make our taskeasy.c41c.jpg (326K)Full SizeHaving done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken placeto the renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience tothe hour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possessionof the prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovelyZoraida. The time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longedfor arrived; and, all following out the arrangement and plan which,after careful consideration and many a long discussion, we had decidedupon, we succeeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Fridayfollowing the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, therenegade anchored his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spotwhere she was. The Christians who were to row were ready and in hidingin different places round about, all waiting for me, anxious andelated, and eager to attack the vessel they had before their eyes; forthey did not know the renegade’s plan, but expected that they were togain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who wereon board the vessel. As soon, then, as I and my comrades made ourappearance, all those that were in hiding seeing us came and joined us.It was now the time when the city gates are shut, and there was no oneto be seen in all the space outside. When we were collected together wedebated whether it would be better first to go for Zoraida, or to makeprisoners of the Moorish rowers who rowed in the vessel; but while wewere still uncertain our renegade came up asking us what kept us, as itwas now the time, and all the Moors were off their guard and most ofthem asleep. We told him why we hesitated, but he said it was of moreimportance first to secure the vessel, which could be done with thegreatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for Zoraida.We all approved of what he said, and so without further delay, guidedby him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board first, drew hiscutlass and said in Morisco, “Let no one stir from this if he does notwant it to cost him his life.” By this almost all the Christians wereon board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captainspeak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking tohis arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted withoutsaying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured them,threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would beall put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of ourparty being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again takingthe renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato’s garden, andas good luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily asif it had not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, wereached the house without being perceived by anybody. The lovelyZoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she perceivedthat there were people there, she asked in a low voice if we were“Nizarani,” as much as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answeredthat we were, and begged her to come down. As soon as she recognised meshe did not delay an instant, but without answering a word came downimmediately, opened the door and presented herself before us all, sobeautiful and so richly attired that I cannot attempt to describe her.The moment I saw her I took her hand and kissed it, and the renegadeand my two comrades did the same; and the rest, who knew nothing of thecircumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only seemed as if we werereturning thanks to her, and recognising her as the giver of ourliberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language if her fatherwas in the house. She replied that he was and that he was asleep.“Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us,” said therenegade, “and everything of value in this fair mansion.”“Nay,” said she, “my father must not on any account be touched, andthere is nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that willbe quite enough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and youshall see,” and so saying she went in, telling us she would returnimmediately and bidding us keep quiet without making any noise.I asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me,I declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with thewishes of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full ofgold crowns that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her fatherawoke while this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, cameto the window, and at once perceiving that all those who were therewere Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to callout in Arabic, “Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!” by whichcries we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; butthe renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was forhim to effect his purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmostquickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of ourparty; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almostfainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted sopromptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato withhis hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented himfrom uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt tospeak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught sight of himshe covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father washorror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had placed herself inour hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on the move, andcarefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who hadremained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishaphaving befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when wewere all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from thehands of Zoraida’s father, and the napkin from his mouth; but therenegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take hislife. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, andstill more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and thatshe lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing anyreluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry intoeffect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way withthe oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound,bade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moorsand setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herselfin the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to becarried away captive before her eyes and on her account. The renegaderepeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so;but he replied that it was not advisable, because if they were leftthere they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, andlead to the despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken,by sea or land, without any possibility of escape; and that all thatcould be done was to set them free on the first Christian ground wereached. On this point we all agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it wasexplained, together with the reasons that prevented us from doing atonce what she desired, was satisfied likewise; and then in glad silenceand with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar, andcommending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to shape ourcourse for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian land. Owing,however, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea growingsomewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight course forMajorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of Oran, notwithout great uneasiness on our part lest we should be observed fromthe town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more than sixtymiles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that courseone of the galliots that usually come with goods from Tetuan; althougheach of us for himself and all of us together felt confident that, ifwe were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were not a cruiser, notonly should we not be lost, but that we should take a vessel in whichwe could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we pursued our courseZoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her father, andI felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us.c41d.jpg (266K)Full SizeWe might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some threemusket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and withoutanyone to see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out alittle to sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained abouttwo leagues the word was given to row by batches, while we atesomething, for the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it wasnot a time to take any rest; let food be served out to those who werenot rowing, but they would not leave their oars on any account. Thiswas done, but now a stiff breeze began to blow, which obliged us toleave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for Oran, as it wasimpossible to make any other course. All this was done very promptly,and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear,except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition. Wegave the Moorish rowers some food, and the renegade comforted them bytelling them that they were not held as captives, as we should set themfree on the first opportunity.The same was said to Zoraida’s father, who replied, “Anything else,Christian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity andgood behaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you willgive me my liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to thedanger of depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously,especially as you know who I am and the sum you may expect to receiveon restoring it; and if you will only name that, I here offer you allyou require for myself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else forher alone, for she is the greatest and most precious part of my soul.”As he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all withcompassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw himweeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throwher arms round him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way tosuch an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keepthem company.But when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels abouther, he said to her in his own language, “What means this, my daughter?Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plungedbefell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now,without having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing theeany joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedeckingthyself, I see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in mypower to give thee when fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this;for it causes me greater anxiety and surprise than even this misfortuneitself.”The renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his daughter; she,however, returned him no answer. But when he observed in one corner ofthe vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, whichhe well knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden,he was still more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come intoour hands, and what there was in it. To which the renegade, withoutwaiting for Zoraida to reply, made answer, “Do not trouble thyself byasking thy daughter Zoraida so many questions, señor, for the oneanswer I will give thee will serve for all; I would have thee know thatshe is a Christian, and that it is she who has been the file for ourchains and our deliverer from captivity. She is here of her own freewill, as glad, I imagine, to find herself in this position as he whoescapes from darkness into the light, from death to life, and fromsuffering to glory.”“Daughter, is this true, what he says?” cried the Moor.“It is,” replied Zoraida.“That thou art in truth a Christian,” said the old man, “and that thouhast given thy father into the power of his enemies?”To which Zoraida made answer, “A Christian I am, but it is not I whohave placed thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leavethee or do thee harm, but only to do good to myself.”“And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?” said he.“Ask thou that,” said she, “of Lela Marien, for she can tell theebetter than I.”The Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness heflung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would havebeen drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for alittle on the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to savehim, and we all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drewhim in half drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in suchdistress that she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though hewere already dead. We turned him upon his face and he voided a greatquantity of water, and at the end of two hours came to himself.Meanwhile, the wind having changed we were compelled to head for theland, and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was ourgood fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a smallpromontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the “Cava rumia,” whichin our language means “the wicked Christian woman;” for it is atradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was lost, liesburied at that spot; “cava” in their language meaning “wicked woman,”and “rumia” “Christian;” moreover, they count it unlucky to anchorthere when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. Forus, however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but ahaven of safety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up. Weposted a look-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands,and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and OurLady with all our hearts to help and protect us, that we might give ahappy ending to a beginning so prosperous. At the entreaty of Zoraidaorders were given to set on shore her father and the other Moors whowere still bound, for she could not endure, nor could her tender heartbear to see her father in bonds and her fellow-countrymen prisonersbefore her eyes. We promised her to do this at the moment of departure,for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at thatplace.Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, forafter a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm,inviting us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeingthis we unbound the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at whichthey were filled with amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida’sfather, who had now completely recovered his senses, he said:“Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced atyour giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the affection shebears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presenceoffers to the execution of her base designs. And think not that it isher belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to changeher religion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is morefreely practised in your country than in ours.” Then turning toZoraida, while I and another of the Christians held him fast by botharms, lest he should do some mad act, he said to her, “Infamous girl,misguided maiden, whither in thy blindness and madness art thou goingin the hands of these dogs, our natural enemies? Cursed be the hourwhen I begot thee! Cursed the luxury and indulgence in which I rearedthee!”But seeing that he was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put himon shore, and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentationsaloud; calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confoundus, to make an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail,we could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how heplucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground.But once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hearwhat he said. “Come back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgivethee all; let those men have the money, for it is theirs now, and comeback to comfort thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his life onthis barren strand if thou dost leave him.”c41e.jpg (281K)Full SizeAll this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all shecould say in answer was, “Allah grant that Lela Marien, who has made mebecome a Christian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father. Allahknows that I could not do otherwise than I have done, and that theseChristians owe nothing to my will; for even had I wished not toaccompany them, but remain at home, it would have been impossible forme, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of thispurpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, itseems wicked.”But neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she saidthis; and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to ourvoyage, in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that wemade sure of finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow bydaybreak. But, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, withoutbeing attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shockto it, our fortune, or perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled athis daughter (for whatever kind of father they may come from these arealways to be dreaded), brought it about that when we were now inmid-sea, and the night about three hours spent, as we were running withall sail set and oars lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us thetrouble of using them, we saw by the light of the moon, which shonebrilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail close to us, luffingup and standing across our course, and so close that we had to strikesail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put the helm hard upto let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were,whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this inFrench our renegade said, “Let no one answer, for no doubt these areFrench corsairs who plunder all comers.”c41f.jpg (268K)Full SizeActing on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone alittle ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly theyfired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for withone they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sailinto the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ballinto our vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doingany further damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began toshout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we werebeginning to fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, asmany as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and theirmatches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few wewere, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling usthat this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them ananswer. Our renegade took the trunk containing Zoraida’s wealth anddropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did. In shortwe went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained allthey wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as ifthey had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took eventhe anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her didnot distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her ofher rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the mostprecious jewel that she valued more than all. The desires, however, ofthose people do not go beyond money, but of that their covetousness isinsatiable, and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch thatthey would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they hadbeen worth anything to them. It was the advice of some of them to throwus all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their purpose was totrade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves out as Bretons,and if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as therobbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the one who hadplundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the prize hehad got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass theStraits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for LaRochelle, from which he had sailed. So they agreed by common consent togive us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for theshort voyage that remained to us, and this they did the next day oncoming in sight of the Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt,all our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if theyhad never been endured by us, such is the delight of recovering lostliberty.It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, givingus two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I knownot what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gaveher some forty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take fromher those same garments which she has on now. We got into the boat,returning them thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselvesgrateful rather than indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for thestraits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we had beforeus, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were sonear that we might easily, we thought, land before the night was faradvanced. But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky wasclouded, and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to usa prudent thing to make for the shore, as several of us advised, sayingwe ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far fromany habitation, for in this way we should be relieved from theapprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the Tetuancorsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall and are on the Spanish coastby daybreak, where they commonly take some prize, and then go home tosleep in their own houses. But of the conflicting counsels the onewhich was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and land wherewe could if the sea were calm enough to permit us. This was done, and alittle before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and loftymountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space onwhich to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the sand, and allsprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfactionreturned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to uson our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions it contained, anddrew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the mountain,for even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuadeourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.The dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; wecompleted the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitationor any shepherds’ huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as wemight, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could weperceive. However, we determined to push on farther, as it could notbut be that ere long we must see someone who could tell us where wewere. But what distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot overthat rough ground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, shewas more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so shewould never again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on verypatiently and cheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gonerather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bellfell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, andlooking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed ayoung shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with hisknife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising hishead, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, thefirst who presented themselves to his sight were the renegade andZoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he imagined that all theMoors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with marvellous swiftnessinto the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a prodigiousoutcry, exclaiming, “The Moors—the Moors have landed! To arms, toarms!” We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowingwhat to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raisethe country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to seewhat was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off hisTurkish garments and put on a captive’s jacket or coat which one of ourparty gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; andso commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we sawthe shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would bedown upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had notpassed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, weperceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at ahand-gallop. As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for them;but as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest of,saw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of themasked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd havingraised the call to arms. I said “Yes,” and as I was about to explain tohim what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of theChristians of our party recognised the horseman who had put thequestion to us, and before I could say anything more he exclaimed:“Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, ifI do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malagaunless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable torecollect that you, señor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante,my uncle.”The Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horsemanthrew himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:“Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have Imourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kinthat are still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve thatthey may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since thatthou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and thoseof all this company, I conclude that ye have had a miraculousrestoration to liberty.”“It is true,” replied the young man, “and by-and-by we will tell youall.”As soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives,they dismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us tothe city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Someof them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told them wherewe had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placedon the horse of the young man’s uncle. The whole town came out to meetus, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who hadgone on in advance. They were not astonished to see liberated captivesor captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see bothone and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida,which was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travellingas by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of allfear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face,that unless my affection for her were deceiving me, I would venture tosay that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world—at least,that I had ever seen. We went straight to the church to return thanksto God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it shesaid there were faces there like Lela Marien’s. We told her they wereher images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her whatthey meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the verysame Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having greatintelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all hesaid to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us allin different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, andmyself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of hisparents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated uswith as much kindness as they did their own son.We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, havinginformed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out forthe city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of theChurch through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other releasedcaptives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him,and Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crownswhich the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out ofwhich I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the presentattending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we arenow going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothershas had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has mademe the companion of Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned tome, however happy, that I would rather have. The patience with whichshe endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and theeagerness she shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill mewith admiration, and bind me to serve her all my life; though thehappiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine, is disturbed andmarred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her inmy own country, or whether time and death may not have made suchchanges in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that Ishall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive.I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be aninteresting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all Ican say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although myfear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.c41g.jpg (33K)CHAPTER XLII.WHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERALOTHER THINGS WORTH KNOWINGc42a.jpg (139K)Full SizeWith these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said tohim, “In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related thisremarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty andstrangeness of the matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, andabounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder andastonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listeningto it that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even thoughto-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale.” And whilehe said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service tohim in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language sokindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by theirgood-will. In particular Don Fernando offered, if he would go back withhim, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptismof Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of makinghis appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he wasentitled to. For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously,although he would not accept any of their generous offers.By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn acoach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; towhich the landlady replied that there was not a hand’s breadth of thewhole inn unoccupied.“Still, for all that,” said one of those who had entered on horseback,“room must be found for his lordship the Judge here.”At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, “Señor, the factis I have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him,as no doubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and Iwill give up our room to accommodate his worship.”“Very good, so be it,” said the squire; but in the meantime a man hadgot out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office andpost he held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he woreshowed that he was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led bythe hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteenyears of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and sograceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made herappearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida,who were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty likethat of this maiden’s would have been hard to find. Don Quixote waspresent at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soonas he saw him he said, “Your worship may with confidence enter and takeyour ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty andpoor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannotmake room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters havebeauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worshiphave in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throwthemselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rendthemselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to giveher a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, forhere you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worshipbrings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence,and beauty in its highest perfection.”The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote,whom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figurethan by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had afresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, andZoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of theyoung lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando,Cardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligibleand polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state ofbewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fairladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the wholehe could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; butwith the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at hiswits’ end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and theaccommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had beenbefore settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that hasbeen already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if toguard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow hisdaughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she didvery willingly; and with part of the host’s narrow bed and half of whatthe Judge had brought with him, they made a more comfortablearrangement for the night than they had expected.The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw theJudge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of theservants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knewfrom what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he wascalled the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard itsaid he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From thisstatement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that thiswas his brother who had adopted letters by his father’s advice; andexcited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and thecurate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them thatthe judge was his brother. The servant had further informed him that hewas now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of theSupreme Court of Mexico; and he had learned, likewise, that the younglady was his daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her,and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him withthe daughter. He asked their advice as to what means he should adopt tomake himself known, or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he hadmade himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor, would be ashamedof him, or would receive him with a warm heart.“Leave it to me to find out that,” said the curate; “though there is noreason for supposing, señor captain, that you will not be kindlyreceived, because the worth and wisdom that your brother’s bearingshows him to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughtyor insensible, or that he will not know how to estimate the accidentsof fortune at their proper value.”“Still,” said the captain, “I would not make myself known abruptly, butin some indirect way.”“I have told you already,” said the curate, “that I will manage it in away to satisfy us all.”By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at thetable, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves intheir own room. In the middle of supper the curate said:“I had a comrade of your worship’s name, Señor Judge, inConstantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that samecomrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the wholeSpanish infantry; but he had as large a share of misfortune as he hadof gallantry and courage.”“And how was the captain called, señor?” asked the Judge.“He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,” replied the curate, “and he wasborn in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned acircumstance connected with his father and his brothers which, had itnot been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set downas one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; forhe said his father had divided his property among his three sons andhad addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato’s. But Ican say this much, that the choice he made of going to the wars wasattended with such success, that by his gallant conduct and courage,and without any help save his own merit, he rose in a few years to becaptain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and inposition to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortunewas against him, for where he might have expected her favour he lostit, and with it his liberty, on that glorious day when so manyrecovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine at the Goletta,and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades atConstantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with one of themost extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world.”Here the curate went on to relate briefly his brother’s adventure withZoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that henever before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, onlywent so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who werein the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and thefair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn whatbecame of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried toFrance by the Frenchmen.The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all thecurate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soonas he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deepsigh and said with his eyes full of tears, “Oh, señor, if you only knewwhat news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me showhow I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of allmy worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speakof is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind thanmy other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling ofarms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, asyour comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. Ifollowed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raisedme to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru,so wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he hasfully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished myfather’s hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity,while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becomingand creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My fatheris still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son,and he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until hehas looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprisesme is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should haveneglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in histroubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or anyof us had known of his condition he need not have waited for thatmiracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me isthe uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him toliberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make mecontinue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, butin the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I onlyknew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out anddeliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me sufferingmyself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou artalive, even wert thou in the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealthand my brother’s and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful andgenerous Zoraida, that I could repay thy goodness to a brother! That Icould be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal thatwould give us all such happiness!”All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the newshe had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it,showing their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, howwell he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain’swishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose fromthe table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by thehand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge’s daughter following her. Thecaptain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter,taking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where theJudge and the other gentlemen were and said, “Let your tears cease toflow, Señor Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully asyou could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and yourgood sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, andthis is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I toldyou of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you mayshow the generosity of your kind heart.”The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on hisbreast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way offbut as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his armsso closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of thosepresent could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged,the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much lessput down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events oftheir lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all itsstrength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed ather disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fairChristian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. Andthere was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedingsattentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole tochimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain andZoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to hisfather of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him tocome and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it wasimpossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was informedthat in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville forNew Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a greatinconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad atthe captive’s good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the nightwere past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. DonQuixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should beattacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of thegreat treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood himreturned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge anaccount of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a littleamused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour forretiring to rest; and he of all was the one that made himself mostcomfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass,which, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear.The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the othershaving disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, DonQuixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as hehad promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approachof dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladiesthat it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea,who had been awake, and by whose side Doña Clara de Viedma, for so theJudge’s daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who itwas that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by anyinstrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were inthe courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were allattention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, “Listen,whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer’s voice thatenchants as it chants.”“We are listening to it already, señor,” said Dorothea; on whichCardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, madeout the words of the song to be these:c42e.jpg (11K)CHAPTER XLIII.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER WITHOTHER STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS IN THE INNc43a.jpg (127K)Full SizeAh me, Love’s mariner am IOn Love’s deep ocean sailing;I know not where the haven lies,I dare not hope to gain it.One solitary distant starIs all I have to guide me,A brighter orb than those of oldThat Palinurus lighted.And vaguely drifting am I borne,I know not where it leads me;I fix my gaze on it alone,Of all beside it heedless.But over-cautious prudery,And coyness cold and cruel,When most I need it, these, like clouds,Its longed-for light refuse me.Bright star, goal of my yearning eyesAs thou above me beamest,When thou shalt hide thee from my sightI’ll know that death is near me.The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fairto let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from sideto side, she woke her, saying:“Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest havethe pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps,in all thy life.”Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment whatDorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said,and Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines,as the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if shewere suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing herarms round Dorothea she said:“Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatestkindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears soas neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.”“What art thou talking about, child?” said Dorothea. “Why, they saythis singer is a muleteer!”“Nay, he is the lord of many places,” replied Clara, “and that one inmy heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unlesshe be willing to surrender it.”Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemedto be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave anypromise of, so she said to her:“You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Señora Clara;explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are sayingabout hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure Iget from listening to the singer by giving my attention to yourtransports, for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and anew air.”“Let him, in Heaven’s name,” returned Clara; and not to hear him shestopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was againsurprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ranin this fashion:Sweet Hope, my stay,That onward to the goal of thy intentDost make thy way,Heedless of hindrance or impediment,Have thou no fearIf at each step thou findest death is near.No victory,No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know;Unblest is heThat a bold front to Fortune dares not show,But soul and senseIn bondage yieldeth up to indolence.If Love his waresDo dearly sell, his right must be contest;What gold comparesWith that whereon his stamp he hath imprest?And all men knowWhat costeth little that we rate but low.Love resoluteKnows not the word “impossibility;”And though my suitBeset by endless obstacles I see,Yet no despairShall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.Here the voice ceased and Clara’s sobs began afresh, all which excitedDorothea’s curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing sosweet and weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she wasgoing to say before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhearher, winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close toher ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyoneelse, and said:“This singer, dear señora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord oftwo villages, who lives opposite my father’s house at Madrid; andthough my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter,and lattice-work in summer, in some way—I know not how—this gentleman,who was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, Icannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know itfrom the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I wasforced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what itwas he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to linkone hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though Ishould have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless Iknew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showinghim no favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, toraise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly,at which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were goingmad. Meanwhile the time for my father’s departure arrived, which hebecame aware of, but not from me, for I had never been able to tell himof it. He fell sick, of grief I believe, and so the day we were goingaway I could not see him to take farewell of him, were it only with theeyes. But after we had been two days on the road, on entering theposada of a village a day’s journey from this, I saw him at the inndoor in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, that if I didnot carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossiblefor me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I was surprised, and glad;he watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he always hideshimself when he crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where wehalt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for love of me hemakes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die ofsorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not withwhat object he has come; or how he could have got away from his father,who loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because hedeserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I cantell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heardthem say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time Isee him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest myfather should recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have neverspoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that Icould not live without him. This, dear señora, is all I have to tellyou about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and fromit alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord ofhearts and towns, as I told you already.”“Say no more, Doña Clara,” said Dorothea at this, at the same timekissing her a thousand times over, “say no more, I tell you, but waittill day comes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours sothat it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves.”“Ah, señora,” said Doña Clara, “what end can be hoped for when hisfather is of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think Iwas not fit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as tomarrying without the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for allthe world. I would not ask anything more than that this youth should goback and leave me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distancewe shall have to travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier;though I daresay the remedy I propose will do me very little good. Idon’t know how the devil this has come about, or how this love I havefor him got in; I such a young girl, and he such a mere boy; for Iverily believe we are both of an age, and I am not sixteen yet; for Iwill be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next, my father says.”Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Doña Claraspoke. “Let us go to sleep now, señora,” said she, “for the little ofthe night that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight,and we will set all to rights, or it will go hard with me.”With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through theinn. The only persons not asleep were the landlady’s daughter and herservant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote’shumour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and onhorseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, orat any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to hisnonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in the whole innthat looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft throughwhich they used to throw out the straw. At this hole the twodemi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse,leaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth such deep anddoleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots witheach of them; and they could hear him, too, saying in a soft, tender,loving tone, “Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection of all beauty,summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary ofvirtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, anddelectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Art thou,perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hathexposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give metidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment,envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and frosome gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she maymitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,what glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, andlastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, ohsun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to risebetimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat ofthee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt seeher and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be morejealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that madethee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of thePeneus (for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run onthat occasion) in thy jealousy and love.”Don Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady’sdaughter began to signal to him, saying, “Señor, come over here,please.”At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by thelight of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that someonewas calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to bea window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, suchas he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediatelysuggested itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion,the fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome bylove for him, was once more endeavouring to win his affections; andwith this idea, not to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, heturned Rocinante’s head and approached the hole, and as he perceivedthe two wenches he said:“I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed yourthoughts of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such areturn can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentlebirth, for which you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whomlove renders incapable of submission to any other than her whom, thefirst moment his eyes beheld her, he made absolute mistress of hissoul. Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not,by any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show myselfmore ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find thatthere is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, providedit be not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by thatsweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be thatyou require of me a lock of Medusa’s hair, which was all snakes, oreven the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.”“My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,” said Maritornesat this.“What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?” replied DonQuixote.“Only one of your fair hands,” said Maritornes, “to enable her to ventover it the great passion, passion which has brought her to thisloophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her fatherhad heard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.”“I should like to see that tried,” said Don Quixote; “but he had betterbeware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous endthat ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tenderlimbs of a love-stricken daughter.”Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she hadasked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the holeand went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza’sass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote hadplanted himself standing on Rocinante’s saddle in order to reach thegrated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and givingher his hand, he said, “Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge ofthe evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other handof woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession ofmy entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but thatyou may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of themuscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may inferwhat must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.”“That we shall see presently,” said Maritornes, and making a runningknot on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down fromthe hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of thestraw-loft.Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,“Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat itnot so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolutionhas given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small apart; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself socruelly.”But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote’s, foras soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready todie with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it wasimpossible for him to release himself.He was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passedthrough the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and inmighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinantewere to stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make theleast movement, although from the patience and imperturbabledisposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he wouldstand without budging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then,and that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this wasdone by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castlethat enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed inhis heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter thecastle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being asettled point with knights-errant that when they have tried anadventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is notreserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not tryit again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could releasehimself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were invain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, buttry as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for itbut to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished forthe sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had anypower; then he cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss theworld would sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted,for that he believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took tothinking of his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he called to hisworthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and stretched upon thepack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the motherthat bore him; then he called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife tocome to his aid; then he invoked his good friend Urganda to succourhim; and then, at last, morning found him in such a state ofdesperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull, for hehad no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering, which hebelieved would last for ever, inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of thishe was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much orlittle, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain inthis state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the maligninfluence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more sageenchanter should disenchant him.But he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight hadhardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men onhorseback, well equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across theirsaddle-bows. They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn,which was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where hewas, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud andimperious tone, “Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have noright to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough thatthey who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit ofthrowing open the fortress until the sun’s rays are spread over thewhole surface of the earth. Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it isbroad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or notto open to you.”“What the devil fortress or castle is this,” said one, “to make usstand on such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us;we are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for weare in haste.”“Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?” said DonQuixote.“I don’t know what you look like,” replied the other; “but I know thatyou are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.”“A castle it is,” returned Don Quixote, “nay, more, one of the best inthis whole province, and it has within it people who have had thesceptre in the hand and the crown on the head.”“It would be better if it were the other way,” said the traveller, “thesceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe thereis within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing tohave those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn asthis, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any peopleentitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.”“You know but little of the world,” returned Don Quixote, “since youare ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.”But the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue withDon Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so thatthe host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he gotup to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of thehorses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante,who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless,supporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all,flesh, though he looked as if he were made of wood, he could not helpgiving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer himattentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost hisfooting; and slipping off the saddle, he would have come to the ground,but for being suspended by the arm, which caused him such agony that hebelieved either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; andhe hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet,which was all the worse for him; for, finding how little was wanted toenable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled and stretched himselfas much as he could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing thetorture of the strappado, when they are fixed at “touch and no touch,”who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretchthemselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with avery little more they will reach the ground.c43b.jpg (272K)Full Sizec43e.jpg (20K)CHAPTER XLIV.IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INNc44a.jpg (144K)Full SizeSo loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlordopening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ranto see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joinedhim. Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the sameoutcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyoneseeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, anddown he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and thetravellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him thathe shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist,and rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on hisarm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of theplain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming:“Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, providedmy lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I givehim the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.”The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote;but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, andnot to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked thelandlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age hadcome to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such anappearance, describing that of Doña Clara’s lover. The landlord repliedthat there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the personthey were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in whichthe Judge had come, said, “He is here no doubt, for this is the coachhe is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in tolook for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round theinn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.” “So be it,” saidanother; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate andthe other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, thelandlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking allthese precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youthwhose description they had given him.It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as inconsequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake andup, but particularly Doña Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able tosleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her loverso near her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when hesaw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him orreplied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignationand wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalrythat it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage inanother enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not toinvolve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which hewas pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would havemade them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering thatit would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise untilhe had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained tohold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of theproceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth theywere seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thoughtof anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him.The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, “It becomes you wellindeed, Señor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bedin which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother rearedyou.”The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who heldhim, but presently recognised him as one of his father’s servants, atwhich he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find orutter a word; while the servant went on to say, “There is nothing forit now, Señor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unlessit is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departurefor the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of thegrief he is in at your absence.”“But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in thisdress?” said Don Luis.“It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,” answered theservant, “that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he sawyour father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of hisservants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, betterpleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be ableto restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.”“That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,” returned Don Luis.“What can you please or heaven order,” said the other, “except to agreeto go back? Anything else is impossible.”All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer atwhose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had takenplace to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this timedressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youthas “Don,” and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return tohis father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and whatthey already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him,they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, andeven to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; sothey hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with hisservant. Dorothea at this instant came out of her room, followed byDoña Clara all in a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she told him ina few words the story of the musician and Doña Clara, and he at thesame time told her what had happened, how his father’s servants hadcome in search of him; but in telling her so, he did not speak lowenough but that Doña Clara heard what he said, at which she was so muchagitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her she would havefallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room,as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did ashe desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now comeinto the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console hisfather at once and without a moment’s delay. He replied that he couldnot do so on any account until he had concluded some business in whichhis life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him,saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and thatthey would take him away whether he liked it or not.“You shall not do that,” replied Don Luis, “unless you take me dead;though however you take me, it will be without life.”By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by thedispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, theJudge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now consideredthere was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man’s story, asked themen who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking tocarry off this youth against his will.“Our object,” said one of the four, “is to save the life of his father,who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman’s disappearance.”Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, “There is no need to make my affairspublic here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, noneof you shall compel me.”“Reason will compel your worship,” said the man, “and if it has nopower over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for,and what it is our duty to do.”“Let us hear what the whole affair is about,” said the Judge at this;but the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, “Do younot know this gentleman, Señor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour,who has run away from his father’s house in a dress so unbecoming hisrank, as your worship may perceive.”The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, andembracing him said, “What folly is this, Señor Don Luis, or what canhave been the cause that could have induced you to come here in thisway, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?”Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter aword in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to beuneasy, for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking DonLuis by the hand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his havingcome there.But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gateof the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who hadpassed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what itwas the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off withoutpaying what they owed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairsmore than other people’s, caught them going out of the gate anddemanded his reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with suchlanguage that he drove them to reply with their fists, and so theybegan to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cryout, and call for help. The landlady and her daughter could see no onemore free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him the daughter said,“Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, fortwo wicked men are beating him to a mummy.”To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied,“Fair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for Iam debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have broughtto a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but thatwhich I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell yourfather to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on noaccount to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and requestpermission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him inhis distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve himfrom it.”“Sinner that I am,” exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; “before youhave got your permission my master will be in the other world.”“Give me leave, señora, to obtain the permission I speak of,” returnedDon Quixote; “and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is inthe other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the sameworld can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over thosewho shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderatelysatisfied;” and without saying anything more he went and knelt beforeDorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to bepleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan ofthat castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess grantedit graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm anddrawing his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests werestill handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spothe stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landladyasked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband.“I hesitate,” said Don Quixote, “because it is not lawful for me todraw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squireSancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair andbusiness.”Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very livelyexchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlordand to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, whowere furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and thehard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But letus leave him there; for he will surely find someone to help him, and ifnot, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than hisstrength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see whatDon Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning himprivately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heartwas troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, madeanswer:“Señor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,through heaven’s will and our being near neighbours, I first saw DoñaClara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her themistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers noimpediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left myfather’s house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow herwhithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor thepole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may havelearned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes werefilled with tears. You know already, señor, the wealth and noble birthof my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficientinducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me atonce as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of hisown, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, timehas more power to alter and change things, than human will.”With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, afterhearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at themanner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret ofhis heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowingwhat course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All theanswer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy forthe present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back thatday, so that there might be time to consider what was best for allparties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with histears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to saythat of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived howadvantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were itpossible, he would have preferred that it should be brought about withthe consent of the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a titlefor his son.The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, bypersuasion and Don Quixote’s fair words more than by threats, they hadpaid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waitingfor the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master’sdecision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber,from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino’s helmet, and Sancho Panza thetrappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at thisinstant enter the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to thestable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or otherbelonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, andmade bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, “Ho, sir thief, I have caughtyou! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings thatyou robbed me of.”Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abusepoured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with theother gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. Thebarber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had madein the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry thateveryone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrelmeant. “Here, in the name of the king and justice!” he cried, “thisthief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover myproperty.”“You lie,” said Sancho, “I am no highwayman; it was in fair war mymaster Don Quixote won these spoils.”Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see hissquire’s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that timeforth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dubhim a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feelingsure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,“Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death,and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my assin the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does notfit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same dayI was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin,never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.”At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; andinterposing between the two, and separating them, he placed thepack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth wasestablished, and said, “Your worships may perceive clearly and plainlythe error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basinwhich was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from himin fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawfulpossession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I maytell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission tostrip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon’s steed, and withit adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its havingbeen changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give noexplanation except the usual one, that such transformations will takeplace in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho myson, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.”“Egad, master,” said Sancho, “if we have no other proof of our casethan what your worship puts forward, Mambrino’s helmet is just as mucha basin as this good fellow’s caparison is a pack-saddle.”“Do as I bid thee,” said Don Quixote; “it cannot be that everything inthis castle goes by enchantment.”Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him,and when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:“Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert thatthis is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by theorder of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one Itook from him, without anything added to or taken from it.”“There is no doubt of that,” said Sancho, “for from the time my masterwon it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loosethose unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for thisbasin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for therewas plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.”c44e.jpg (13K)CHAPTER XLV.IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO’S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLEIS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH ANDEARNESTc45a.jpg (154K)Full Size“What do you think now, gentlemen,” said the barber, “of what thesegentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?”“And whoever says the contrary,” said Don Quixote, “I will let him knowhe lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again athousand times.”Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood DonQuixote’s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up hisdelusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressingthe other barber he said:“Señor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to yourprofession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twentyyears, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one ofthem, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in thedays of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and aheadpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, Imeant to say to soldiers’ arms; and I say—saving better opinions andalways with submission to sounder judgments—that this piece we have nowbefore us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is nobarber’s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black,and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is ahelmet, is not a complete helmet.”“Certainly not,” said Don Quixote, “for half of it is wanting, that isto say the beaver.”“It is quite true,” said the curate, who saw the object of his friendthe barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed withhim, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of DonLuis’s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was sotaken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paidlittle or no attention to these facetious proceedings.“God bless me!” exclaimed their butt the barber at this; “is itpossible that such an honourable company can say that this is not abasin but a helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a wholeuniversity, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is ahelmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse’s caparison, as thisgentleman has said.”“To me it looks like a pack-saddle,” said Don Quixote; “but I havealready said that with that question I do not concern myself.”“As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,” said the curate, “it isonly for Señor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry allthese gentlemen and I bow to his authority.”“By God, gentlemen,” said Don Quixote, “so many strange things havehappened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I havesojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positivelyin reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is mybelief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. Thefirst time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble,nor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last nightI was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowinghow or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forwardto give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rashdecision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not ahelmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whetherthis is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give apositive opinion, but will leave it to your worships’ better judgment.Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments ofthis place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties areunfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really andtruly are, and not as they appear to me.”“There can be no question,” said Don Fernando on this, “but that SeñorDon Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decisionof this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will takethe votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearlyand fully.”To those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote’s humour all thisafforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, itseemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the fourservants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to threeother travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had theappearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were;but the one who above all was at his wits’ end was the barber whosebasin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino’shelmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about tobecome a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernandogoing from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to themto give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which therehad been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but afterhe had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud,“The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a numberof opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what Idesire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that thisis the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, ofa thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and yourass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated andproved your case very badly.”“May I never share heaven,” said the poor barber, “if your worships arenot all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears tome a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, ‘laws go,’—I say no more;and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.”The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than theabsurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:“There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs tohim, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.”But said one of the four servants, “Unless, indeed, this is adeliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men sointelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declareand assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but asI perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to theconclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is soopposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself; for I swearby”—and here he rapped out a round oath—“all the people in the worldwill not make me believe that this is not a barber’s basin and that ajackass’s pack-saddle.”“It might easily be a she-ass’s,” observed the curate.“It is all the same,” said the servant; “that is not the point; butwhether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.”On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood,who had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable torestrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, “It is a pack-saddle assure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will sayanything else must be drunk.”“You lie like a rascally clown,” returned Don Quixote; and lifting hispike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blowat his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would havestretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces againstthe ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comradeassaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.The landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staffof office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of hiscomrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he shouldescape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turnedupside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did thesame; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luiscried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help DonQuixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him; thecurate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady wasscreaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorotheawas aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Doña Clara in a faint. Thebarber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gaveone of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep himfrom escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge tookhis part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and wasbelabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again callingfor help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothingbut cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps,sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in themidst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, DonQuixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thickof the discord of Agramante’s camp; and, in a voice that shook the innlike thunder, he cried out:“Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend tome as they value their lives!”All paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, “Did I not tellyou, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so ofdevils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold withyour own eyes how the discord of Agramante’s camp has come hither, andbeen transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there forthe sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this forthe helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then,you, Señor Judge, and you, señor curate; let the one represent KingAgramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for byGod Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality aswe are should slay one another for such trifling cause.” The officers,who did not understand Don Quixote’s mode of speaking, and foundthemselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and theircompanions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for bothhis beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancholike a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while thefour servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little theygained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that theymust punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised adisturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for thepresent; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment,and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote’simagination.All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of theJudge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge himto return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matterwith them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and thecurate as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how itstood, and what Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length thatDon Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and thatit was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia,where he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome hisquality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from thedetermination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father atpresent, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of DonFernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled itbetween themselves that three of them should return to tell his fatherhow matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon DonLuis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father’sorders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom ofKing Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but theenemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and madea fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involvedthem all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his handonce more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning therank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from thecontest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likelyto get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had beenthrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among somewarrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had oneagainst Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to bearrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with verygood reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished tosatisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote’s features corresponded; andtaking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in searchof, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quickreader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, andwent on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, anddiscovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. Assoon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took thewarrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by thecollar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shoutedaloud, “Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand itin earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to bearrested.”The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said wastrue, and that it agreed with Don Quixote’s appearance, who, on hispart, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints crackingwith rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with allhis might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would haveyielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord,who had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aidthem. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a freshquarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediatelycaught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and allpresent for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, “Bythe Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantmentsof this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!”Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutualcontentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one thecoat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this,however, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and callon them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as wasrequired for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, onwhose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect thecapture of this robber and footpad of the highways.Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly,“Come now, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to givefreedom to those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour themiserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamousbeings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heavenshould not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry,or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse torespect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! Comenow; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licenceof the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed awarrant of arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that didnot know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, thattheir law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edictstheir will? Who, I say again, was the fool that knows not that thereare no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges orexemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight,and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? Whatknight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen’s pin-money, king’s dues,toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making hisclothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made himpay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel wasnot enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his willand pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there,or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give,single-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of theHoly Brotherhood if they come in his way?”CHAPTER XLVI.OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLYBROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DONQUIXOTEc46a.jpg (163K)Full SizeWhile Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate wasendeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, asthey might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need notpress the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carriedhim off, they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to whichthe holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do withinquiring into Don Quixote’s madness, but only to execute hissuperior’s orders, and that once taken they might let him go threehundred times if they liked.“For all that,” said the curate, “you must not take him away this time,nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.”In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such madthings, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if theyhad not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best toallow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers betweenthe barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation withmuch bitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled thequestion by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if notperfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for theychanged the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as toMambrino’s helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote’sknowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed afull receipt and engagement to make no further demand then orthenceforth for evermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the mostimportant and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servantsof Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one wasleft to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; andgood luck and better fortune, having already begun to solvedifficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers andwarriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything toa happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; whichgave Doña Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into herface just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though shedid not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowingwhy, as she watched and studied the various countenances, butparticularly her Spaniard’s, whom she followed with her eyes and clungto with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave thebarber had not escaped the landlord’s notice, and he demanded DonQuixote’s reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to hiswine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinantenor Sancho’s ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to thevery last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernandopaid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score;and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer remindedone of the discord of Agramante’s camp, as Don Quixote said, but of thepeace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it wasthe universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal andeloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled generosity of DonFernando.Finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire’s aswell as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable tocontinue the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that greatadventure for which he had been called and chosen; and with this highresolve he went and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would notallow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose,and said, “It is a common proverb, fair lady, that ‘diligence is themother of good fortune,’ and experience has often shown in importantaffairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful caseto a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itselfmore plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall thedevices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time todefend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because itseems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now isuseless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find outsome day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learnedby means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him,and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himselfin some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my effortsand the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little? Therefore,lady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and letus depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is onlykept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay inencountering your adversary.”Don Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the replyof the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a styleadapted to Don Quixote’s own, replied to him in these words, “I giveyou thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight towhom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy,display to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that yourwishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there arewomen in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it beforthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely inaccordance with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted toyou the defence of her person, and placed in your hands the recovery ofher dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which yourwisdom may ordain.”“On, then, in God’s name,” said Don Quixote; “for, when a lady humblesherself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up andplacing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, forthe common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to myeagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hellseen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, andget ready thy ass and the queen’s palfrey, and let us take leave of thecastellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.”Sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, “Ah!master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hearsof, begging all good bodies’ pardon.”“What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of theworld, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?” said Don Quixote.“If your worship is angry,” replied Sancho, “I will hold my tongue andleave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a goodservant should tell his master.”“Say what thou wilt,” returned Don Quixote, “provided thy words be notmeant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behavinglike thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.”“It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,” said Sancho,“but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who callsherself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than mymother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noseswith one that is here every instant and behind every door.”Dorothea turned red at Sancho’s words, for the truth was that herhusband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were notlooking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned,and Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like acourtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unableor not caring to answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued,“This I say, señor, because, if after we have travelled roads andhighways, and passed bad nights and worse days, one who is now enjoyinghimself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours, there is noneed for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on theass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stayquiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to dinner.”Good God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard theaudacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voiceinarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashedliving fire, he exclaimed, “Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, andignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!Hast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of theseillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shamelessthoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou bornmonster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,inventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respectdue to royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me underpain of my wrath;” and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out hischeeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with hisright foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in hisheart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared andterrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened thatinstant and swallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round andmake his escape from the angry presence of his master.But the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood DonQuixote’s humour, said, to mollify his wrath, “Be not irritated at theabsurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the RuefulCountenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and fromhis good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he wouldbear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, withoutany hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in thiscastle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, Isay, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what hesays he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.”“I swear by God Omnipotent,” exclaimed Don Quixote at this, “yourhighness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have comebefore this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would havebeen impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I knowwell enough, from the poor fellow’s goodness and harmlessness, that heis incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.”“True, no doubt,” said Don Fernando, “for which reason, Señor DonQuixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of yourfavour, _sicut erat in principio_, before illusions of this sort hadtaken away his senses.”Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went forSancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged forthe hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed himto kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, “Now, Sancho my son, thouwilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee,that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.”“So it is, I believe,” said Sancho, “except the affair of the blanket,which came to pass in reality by ordinary means.”“Believe it not,” said Don Quixote, “for had it been so, I would haveavenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now couldI, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.”They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and thelandlord gave them a minute account of Sancho’s flights, at which theylaughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less outof countenance had not his master once more assured him it was allenchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitchthat he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,without any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed bybeings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms,as his master believed and protested.The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as itseemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, withoutgiving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with DonQuixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona,the curate and the barber might carry him away with them as theyproposed, and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home;and in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of anoxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him after thisfashion. They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enoughto hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and hiscompanions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of theBrotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and adviceof the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some inone way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quitedifferent from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, inprofound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking hisrest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleepingtranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seizedhim firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awokestartled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder atthe strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave wayto the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him,and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of theenchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted ashe could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, theconcoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were thereSancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his ownproper character, and he, though he was within very little of sharinghis master’s infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all thesedisguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until hesaw what came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did thelatter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which wasthat bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and nailed the barsso firmly that they could not be easily burst open.c46b.jpg (342K)Full SizeThey then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of theroom an awful voice—as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddlebut the other, was able to make it—was heard to say, “O Knight of theRueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placedafflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedyaccomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engagedthee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lionand the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having firsthumbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony. And fromthis marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world bravewhelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; andthis shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall inhis swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou,O most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard onface, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see theflower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; forsoon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou shalt seethyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, andthe promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false;and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, that thywages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow thenthe footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient thatthou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as itis not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return tothat place I wot of;” and as he brought the prophecy to a close heraised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a softtone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclinedto take what they heard seriously.Don Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at oncecomprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised tohim that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony withhis beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceedthe whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and beingthoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, andwith a deep sigh exclaimed, “Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hastforetold me so much good, I implore of thee that on my part thouentreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, that heleave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carryingme away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable asthose which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, andI shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chainswherewith they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me,not as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; andtouching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon hisgoodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evilfortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in mypower to give him the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it,at least his wages shall not be lost; for in my will, which is alreadymade, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him, measured, notby his many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal.”Sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,being tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitionslifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.c46e.jpg (56K)Full SizeCHAPTER XLVII.OF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS CARRIEDAWAY ENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTSc47a.jpg (181K)Full SizeWhen Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way,he said, “Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but neveryet have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchantedknights-errant in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy,sluggish animals promise; for they always take them away through theair with marvellous swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on achariot of fire, or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of thekind; but to carry me off like this on an ox-cart! By God, it puzzlesme! But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take adifferent course from that of those in days gone by; and it may be,too, that as I am a new knight in the world, and the first to revivethe already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may havenewly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carryingoff the enchanted. What thinkest thou of the matter, Sancho my son?”c47b.jpg (357K)Full Size“I don’t know what to think,” answered Sancho, “not being as well readas your worship in errant writings; but for all that I venture to sayand swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quitecatholic.”“Catholic!” said Don Quixote. “Father of me! how can they be Catholicwhen they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come anddo this, and bring me to this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it,touch them, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies ofair, and no consistency except in appearance.”“By God, master,” returned Sancho, “I have touched them already; andthat devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, andanother property very different from what I have heard say devils have,for by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells;but this one smells of amber half a league off.” Sancho was herespeaking of Don Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was verylikely perfumed as Sancho said.“Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote; “for let metell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours aboutwith them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or,if they have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but ofsomething foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hellwith them wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from theirtorments, and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure andenjoyment, it is impossible that they can smell sweet; if, then, thisdevil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou artdeceiving thyself, or he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy heis not a devil.”Such was the conversation that passed between master and man; and DonFernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho’s making a completediscovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside,they directed him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle onSancho’s ass, which he did with great alacrity. In the meantime thecurate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bearthem company as far as his village, he paying them so much a day.Cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante’s saddleand the basin on the other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount hisass and take Rocinante’s bridle, and at each side of the cart he placedtwo officers with their muskets; but before the cart was put in motion,out came the landlady and her daughter and Maritornes to bid DonQuixote farewell, pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune; andto them Don Quixote said:“Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those whofollow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befallme I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such thingsnever happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody inthe world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these areenvied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knightswho compass the destruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless,virtue is of herself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic thatZoroaster its first inventor knew, she will come victorious out ofevery trial, and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon theheavens. Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have inaught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never doneso to any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity towhich some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I findmyself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me inthis castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge,recognise, and requite them as they deserve.”While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and DonQuixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando andhis companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now allmade happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They allembraced one another, and promised to let each other know how thingswent with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write tohim, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that therewas nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, andthat he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thoughthe would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida’s baptism, DonLuis’s affair, and Luscinda’s return to her home. The curate promisedto comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, andrenewed their promises.The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, sayinghe had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novelof “The Ill-advised Curiosity” had been found, and that he might takethem all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, ashe could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thankedhim, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript thewords, “Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,” by which he perceived thatit was a novel, and as that of “The Ill-advised Curiosity” had beengood he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably bythe same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had anopportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same,both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set outfollowing in the rear of the cart. The order of march was this: firstwent the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched theofficers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; thenfollowed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; andbehind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, withfaces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuringtheir pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen. Don Quixote was seatedin the cage, with his hands tied and his feet stretched out, leaningagainst the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statueand not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently they made, it mightbe, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought aconvenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he said so tothe curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought to push on alittle farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared close byhe knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than theone where they proposed to halt; and his advice was taken and theycontinued their journey.Just at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind themsix or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtookthem, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace ofoxen, but like men who rode canons’ mules, and in haste to take theirnoontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not aleague off. The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteoussalutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, infact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him,observing the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers,Sancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixotecaged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning ofcarrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of theofficers, he already concluded that he must be some desperatehighwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within thejurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom hehad put the question, replied, “Let the gentleman himself tell you themeaning of his going this way, señor, for we do not know.”Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, “Haply, gentlemen, youare versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if youare I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in mygiving myself the trouble of relating them;” but here the curate andthe barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversationwith Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as tosave their stratagem from being discovered.The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, “In truth, brother, I knowmore about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando’s elements oflogic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.”“In God’s name, then, señor,” replied Don Quixote; “if that be so, Iwould have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envyand fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by thewicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one ofthose whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in herrecord, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, andall the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophiststhat Ethiopia ever produced, will place their names in the temple ofimmortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come,whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must treadif they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms.”“What Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,” observed the curate, “isthe truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault orsins of his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue isodious and valour hateful. This, señor, is the Knight of the RuefulCountenance, if you have ever heard him named, whose valiantachievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass andimperishable marble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscurethem and malice to hide them.”When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at libertytalk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in hisastonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him; and all hisattendants were in the same state of amazement.At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear theconversation, said, in order to make everything plain, “Well, sirs, youmay like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matteris, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. Heis in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls likeother men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that’sthe case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he isenchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted peopleneither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don’t stop him,will talk more than thirty lawyers.” Then turning to the curate heexclaimed, “Ah, señor curate, señor curate! do you think I don’t knowyou? Do you think I don’t guess and see the drift of these newenchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your faceis covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hideyour tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and wherethere is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide thedevil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be marriedto the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count atleast; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of mymaster, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of myservices. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts,that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and thatthose who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife andchildren, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see theirfather return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom,they will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this, señorcurate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience yourill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call youto account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way,and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord DonQuixote leaves undone while he is shut up.“Trim those lamps there!” exclaimed the barber at this; “so you are ofthe same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to seethat you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchantedlike him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was anevil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, andthat island you long so much for found its way into your head.”“I am not with child by anyone,” returned Sancho, “nor am I a man tolet myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though Iam poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if Ilong for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the sonof his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to saygovernor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that hewill not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber;for shaving is not everything, and there is some difference betweenPeter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and itwill not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment ofmy master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes itworse to stir it.”The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking heshould disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard toconceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canonto ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mysteryof this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. Thecanon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened withattention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways ofDon Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly thebeginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of hisadventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the planthey had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discovera cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anewwhen they heard Don Quixote’s strange story, and when it was finishedhe said, “To tell the truth, señor curate, I for my part consider whatthey call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though,led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost allthat have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of themfrom beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less thesame thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no morethan that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is ofthe same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensicaltales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactlythe opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at thesame time. And though it may be the chief object of such books toamuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full ofsuch monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must comefrom the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in thethings that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothingthat has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.What beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or ofthe whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad ofsixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves ofhim as if he was an almond cake? And when they want to give us apicture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million ofcombatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book beopposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it ornot, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of hisstrong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which aborn queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of someunknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous anduncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full ofknights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, andwill be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land ofPrester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never describednor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that theauthors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore arenot bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction isall the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the morepleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plotsin fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and beconstructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothingover difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise,interest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined maykeep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect whoshuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfectionof writing. I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that putstogether a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that themiddle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning andmiddle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude ofmembers that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera ormonster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all thisthey are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolixin their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels,and, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for whichreason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as aworthless breed.”c47c.jpg (300K)Full SizeThe curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man ofsound understanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; sohe told him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing agrudge to books of chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote’s, whichwere many; and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them,and of those he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared,with which the canon was not a little amused, adding that though he hadsaid so much in condemnation of these books, still he found one goodthing in them, and that was the opportunity they afforded to a giftedintellect for displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spaciousfield over which the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks,tempests, combats, battles, portraying a valiant captain with all thequalifications requisite to make one, showing him sagacious inforeseeing the wiles of the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage orrestrain his soldiers, ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold inbiding his time as in pressing the attack; now picturing some sadtragic incident, now some joyful and unexpected event; here a beauteouslady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there a Christian knight, brave andgentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart; there a courteous prince,gallant and gracious; setting forth the devotion and loyalty ofvassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. “Or again,” said he,“the author may show himself to be an astronomer, or a skilledcosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of state, andsometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if helikes. He can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of Æneas,the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery ofSinon, the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, theboldness of Cæsar, the clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity ofZopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties that serveto make an illustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual,again distributing them among many; and if this be done with charm ofstyle and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible,he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, whenfinished, will display such perfection and beauty that it will attainthe worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I said before, isto give instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted rangeof these books enables the author to show his powers, epic, lyric,tragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesyand oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose justas well as in verse.”c47e.jpg (67K)Full SizeCHAPTER XLVIII.IN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITHOTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WITc48a.jpg (80K)Full Size“It is as you say, señor canon,” said the curate; “and for that reasonthose who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the morecensure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or therules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famousin prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.”“I myself, at any rate,” said the canon, “was once tempted to write abook of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to beobserved; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheetswritten; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showedthem to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned andintelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing butthe pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtainedflattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, aswell because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with myprofession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerousthan the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise fewthan applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself tothe stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of suchbooks falls for the most part.“But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea offinishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays thatare acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now invogue, as well those that are pure invention as those founded onhistory, are, all or most of them, downright nonsense and things thathave neither head nor tail, and yet the public listens to them withdelight, and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are sofar from it; and if the authors who write them, and the players who actthem, say that this is what they must be, for the public wants this andwill have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out aplot according to the laws of art will only find some half-dozenintelligent people to understand them, while all the rest remain blindto the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is betterto get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book willfare the same way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying toobserve the principles I have spoken of, and I shall be ‘the tailor ofthe corner.’ And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actorsthat they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that theywould attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays inaccordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are sothoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence canwean them from it.“I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, ‘Tell me,do you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragediesacted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which weresuch that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, andinterest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as thehigher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these threealone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?’“‘No doubt,’ replied the actor in question, ‘you mean the “Isabella,”the “Phyllis,” and the “Alexandra.”’“‘Those are the ones I mean,’ said I; ‘and see if they did not observethe principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to showtheir superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does notlie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those whodon’t know how to produce something else. “The Ingratitude Revenged”was not nonsense, nor was there any in “The Numantia,” nor any to befound in “The Merchant Lover,” nor yet in “The Friendly Fair Foe,” norin some others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to theirown fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;’some further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left himrather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I coulddisabuse him of his error.”“You have touched upon a subject, señor canon,” observed the curatehere, “that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays invogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to thebooks of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should bethe mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of thetruth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense,models of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense canthere be in connection with what we are now discussing than for aninfant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the firstact, and in the second a grown-up bearded man? Or what greaterabsurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as aswashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language,a page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a princess who isa kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention to thetime in which the action they represent may or can take place, savethat I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the secondin Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been infour acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would havebeen laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life isthe main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible forany average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposedto pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principalpersonage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who enteredJerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey ofBouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?or, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts areintroduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and atdifferent times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblanceof probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of vieware inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people whosay that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affectedrefinement. And then if we turn to sacred dramas—what miracles theyinvent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing toone saint the miracles of another! And even in secular plays theyventure to introduce miracles without any reason or object except thatthey think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, willcome in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. Allthis tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history,nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners whoscrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarousand ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays weproduce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chiefobject well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays tobe performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmlessamusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours whichidleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by anysort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bindthose who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made,since, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort. Tothis I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison,better attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so;for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, thehearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the seriousparts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by thearguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples,inflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways agood play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorishor dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowedwith all these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please muchmore than one wanting in them, like the greater number of those whichare commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to beblamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly wellaware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; but as playshave become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that theactors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so thepoet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is topay him for his work. And that this is the truth may be seen by thecountless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written,with so much brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polishedversification, such choice language, such profound reflections, and ina word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filledthe world with his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suitthe taste of the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, comeas near perfection as they ought. Others write plays with suchheedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have to flyand abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, forhaving acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting tosome noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothingof, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible personat the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not onlythose produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to beacted in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no localmagistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors wouldtake care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them insafety, and those who write them would be more careful and take morepains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to thestrict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good playswould be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as wellthe amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of Spain, theinterest and safety of the actors, and the saving of trouble ininflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some other personwere authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, nodoubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described,enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure ofeloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light ofthe new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, notmerely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot bealways bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawfulamusement.”The canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with theirconversation, when the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said tothe curate, “This is the spot, señor licentiate, that I said was a goodone for fresh and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take ournoontide rest.”“And so it seems,” returned the curate, and he told the canon what heproposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes;and to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom hehad begun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about thedoings of Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to theinn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables theremight be for the whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoonwhere he was; to which one of his servants replied that the sumptermule, which by this time ought to have reached the inn, carriedprovisions enough to make it unnecessary to get anything from the innexcept barley.“In that case,” said the canon, “take all the beasts there, and bringthe sumpter mule back.”While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to hismaster without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had hissuspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which DonQuixote was placed, and said, “Señor, to ease my conscience I want totell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is thatthese two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our villageand the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carryingyou off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worshipsurpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth itfollows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of.And to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me asI believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on thetrick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong inyour wits.”“Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,” returned Don Quixote, “for I willsatisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest,that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, ourneighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem tobe those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact,believe it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think isthat, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those whohave enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easyfor enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have takenthose of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and leadthee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escapethough thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done itto make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence thisevil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that thebarber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and onthe other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that nopower on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shutme in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantmentis of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all thehistories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted? Sothou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thousayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy desireto ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though thoushouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning.”“May Our Lady be good to me!” said Sancho, lifting up his voice; “andis it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short ofbrains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, andthat malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune thanenchantment? But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you arenot enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from thisaffliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it inthe arms of my lady Dulcinea—”“Leave off conjuring me,” said Don Quixote, “and ask what thou wouldstknow; I have already told thee I will answer with all possibleprecision.”“That is what I want,” said Sancho; “and what I would know, and haveyou tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling thewhole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all whoprofess arms, as your worship professes them, under the title ofknights-errant—”“I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,” said Don Quixote;“finish thy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all theseasseverations, requirements, and precautions, Sancho.”“Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,” said Sancho;“and so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask,speaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shutup and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desireor inclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?”“I do not understand ‘going anywhere,’” said Don Quixote; “explainthyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer tothe point.”“Is it possible,” said Sancho, “that your worship does not understand‘going anywhere’? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they werebabes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to dowhat cannot be avoided?”“Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “yes, often, andeven this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.”c48e.jpg (32K)CHAPTER XLIX.WHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITHHIS MASTER DON QUIXOTEc49a.jpg (181K)Full Size“Aha, I have caught you,” said Sancho; “this is what in my heart andsoul I was longing to know. Come now, señor, can you deny what iscommonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, ‘I don’t knowwhat ails so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, norgives a proper answer to any question; one would think he wasenchanted’? From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat,or drink, or sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of—thatsuch persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire yourworship has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there isanything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them.”“What thou sayest is true, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “but I havealready told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may bethat in the course of time they have been changed one for another, andthat now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do,though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or drawinferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I amenchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weighheavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in afaint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in needand distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid andprotection.”“Still for all that,” replied Sancho, “I say that, for your greater andfuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try toget out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help,and even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mountyour good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholyand dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking foradventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough togo back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire,I promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you areso unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out myplan.”“I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I willobey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou artin thy conception of my misfortune.”The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversationtill they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and thebarber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carterat once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about thepleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, notenchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk likehis squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cagefor a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not beas clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required.The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply withhis request, only that he feared his master, finding himself atliberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody couldever find him again.“I will answer for his not running away,” said Sancho.“And I also,” said the canon, “especially if he gives me his word as aknight not to leave us without our consent.”Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, “I give it;—moreoverone who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for hewho had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for threeages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.”—Andthat being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it wouldbe to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, heprotested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unlessthey kept their distance.The canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on hisword and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he wasto find himself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretchhimself all over, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing andgiving him a couple of slaps on the haunches said, “I still trust inGod and in his blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that weshall soon see ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thymaster on thy back, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling forwhich God sent me into the world.” And so saying, accompanied bySancho, he withdrew to a retired spot, from which he came back muchrelieved and more eager than ever to put his squire’s scheme intoexecution.The canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of hismadness, and that in all his remarks and replies he should show suchexcellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said,when the subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion,he said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrivalof the provisions:“Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading ofbooks of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as toupset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like,all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be anyhuman understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all thatinfinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famousknights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes ofHircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, andmonsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and enchantments ofevery kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes,love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters,billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all thatnonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say thatwhen I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that they are alllies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but whenI come to consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at thewall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand, asrichly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of therange of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes oflife, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and acceptas truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, theyeven dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence,as is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when theyhave brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cageand carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger fromplace to place to make money by showing it. Come, Señor Don Quixote,have some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense,and make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased tobestow upon you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some otherreading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to yourhonour. And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to readbooks of achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in theHoly Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds astrue as they are heroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Cæsar,Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count FernanGonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura aDiego García de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo aGarcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deedswill entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them withdelight and wonder. Here, Señor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy ofyour sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners,brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to thehonour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, Iam informed, your worship derives your birth.”Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon’s words,and when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time,he replied to him:“It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship’s discourse isintended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in theworld, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievousand useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them,and worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when Iundertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which theyset forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or ofGreece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.”“It is all exactly as you state it,” said the canon; to which DonQuixote returned, “You also went on to say that books of this kind haddone me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me upin a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change mystudies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasureand instruction.”“Just so,” said the canon.“Well then,” returned Don Quixote, “to my mind it is you who are theone that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured toutter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged andaccepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the samepunishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate youwhen you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and allthe other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, neverexisted, would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does notyield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the worldcan persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy ofBurgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible,which happened in the time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good itis as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be alie too that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or TwelvePeers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives changed into araven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just aswell try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of thequest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram andthe Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere andLancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seenthe Dame Quintañona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. Andso true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father’sside, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me,‘Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintañona,’ from which I concludethat she must have known her, or at least had managed to see someportrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and thefair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king’sarmoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horsehe rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of acart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca’s saddle, and at Roncesvallesthere is Roland’s horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may inferthat there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and otherknights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Orperhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant asthe valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in thecity of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres byname, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique deRemesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour;or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy,by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whosefamily I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the sonsof the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando deGuevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engagedin combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke ofAustria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quiñones, him ofthe ‘Paso,’ and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against theCastilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as wellas many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreignrealms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who deniesthem must be totally wanting in reason and good sense.”The canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction DonQuixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everythingrelating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so hesaid in reply:“I cannot deny, Señor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what yousay, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willingto grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am notdisposed to believe that they did all the things that the ArchbishopTurpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they wereknights chosen by the kings of France, and called ‘Peers’ because theywere all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were notthey ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order likethose of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it isassumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction andgood birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or ofAlcántara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, becausetwelve equals were chosen for that military order. That there was aCid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but thatthey did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. Inthat other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, andsay is near Babieca’s saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I ameither so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen thesaddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being asbig as your worship says it is.”“For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,” said DonQuixote; “and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath ofcowhide to keep it from rusting.”“All that may be,” replied the canon; “but, by the orders I havereceived, I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there,that is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all thoseAmadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, noris it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with somany good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, shouldallow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as arewritten in those absurd books of chivalry are really true.”c49e.jpg (22K)CHAPTER L.OF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD,TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTSc50a.jpg (160K)Full Size“A good joke, that!” returned Don Quixote. “Books that have beenprinted with the king’s licence, and with the approbation of those towhom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, andextolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant,gentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rankor condition they may be—that these should be lies! And above all whenthey carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us thefather, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements,step by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights!Hush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now toact as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see thepleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there beanything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayedbefore us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes andserpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sortsswimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes aplaintive voice saying: ‘Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest thisdread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneaththese dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyselfinto the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not beworthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of theseven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;’ and then the knight,almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider,without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposinghimself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massivearmour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into themidst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knowswhat his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, withwhich the Elysian fields are not to be compared.c50b.jpg (344K)Full Size“The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with astrange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy treespresents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure,while the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countlessbirds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacingbranches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquidcrystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like siftedgold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountainof many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rusticfashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellowmansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled withfragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work ofvaried aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.c50c.jpg (334K)Full Size“Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeouspalace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates ofjacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though thematerials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds,carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship isstill more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be morecharming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate ofthe castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myselfnow to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should neverhave done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them alltakes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand,and without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace orcastle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and batheshim in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with sweet-smellingunguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scentedand perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his shouldersa mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and evenmore? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this,they lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out insuch style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how theypour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scentedflowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damselswait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a varietyof dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss whichto select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, bywhom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is overand the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, pickinghis teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of theothers, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by hisside, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is heldenchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonishthe readers who are perusing his history.c50d.jpg (433K)Full Size“But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gatheredfrom it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant onereads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;and take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books andyou will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raiseyour spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that sinceI have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous,well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and havelearned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and thoughit be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage likea madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortunethwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be ableto show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by myfaith, señor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue ofgenerosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree;and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, justas faith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad werefortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor,so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly tothis poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world;and I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever solong, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern hisrealm.”Sancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,“Strive hard you, Señor Don Quixote, to give me that county so oftenpromised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you therewill be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, Ihave heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, payingso much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government,while the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue theypay him, without troubling himself about anything else. That’s whatI’ll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at onceof the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let thingsgo their own way.”“That, brother Sancho,” said the canon, “only holds good as far as theenjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory mustattend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and soundjudgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out thetruth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the endwill always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions ofthe simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.”“I don’t understand those philosophies,” returned Sancho Panza; “all Iknow is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to governit; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, andI shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so Ishould do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, andpleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he hasnothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire thereis an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and letus see one another, as one blind man said to the other.”“That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,” said the canon;“but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter ofcounties.”To which Don Quixote returned, “I know not what more there is to besaid; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis ofGaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so,without any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza,for he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.”The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense becapable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he haddescribed the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impressionthat the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, andlastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerlyto obtain the county his master had promised him.By this time the canon’s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch thesumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass ofthe meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade ofsome trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not bedeprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said. Asthey were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of abell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes thatwere close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat,spotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicketwith a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries tomake it stop or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared andfrightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection andthen stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns andbegan to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason andunderstanding: “Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have yougone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, mydaughter? Won’t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But whatelse can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? Aplague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Comeback, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at anyrate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if youwho ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will becomeof them?”The goatherd’s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon,who said to him, “As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not insuch a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female,as you say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all youcan do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that willsoothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will restherself,” and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on afork.The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, andthen said, “I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for asimpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; butthe truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am aclown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men andto beasts.”“That I can well believe,” said the curate, “for I know already byexperience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds’ hutsharbour philosophers.”“At all events, señor,” returned the goatherd, “they shelter men ofexperience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, thoughI may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if itwill not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for alittle, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman’s word(and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.”To this Don Quixote replied, “Seeing that this affair has a certaincolour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you mostgladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligencethey possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm,and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. Sobegin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen.”“I draw my stakes,” said Sancho, “and will retreat with this pasty tothe brook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for Ihave heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant’s squireshould eat until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance,because it often happens them to get by accident into a wood so thickthat they cannot find a way out of it for six days; and if the man isnot well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as veryoften he does, turned into a dried mummy.”“Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “go where thouwilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want togive my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this goodfellow’s story.”“It is what we shall all do,” said the canon; and then begged thegoatherd to begin the promised tale.The goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slapson the back, saying, “Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have timeenough to return to our fold.” The goat seemed to understand him, foras her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside himand looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what hewas going to say, and then in these words he began his story.c50e.jpg (27K)CHAPTER LI.WHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DONQUIXOTEc51a.jpg (115K)Full SizeThree leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small,is one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there liveda farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to beso is the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respectedfor his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made himstill more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of suchexceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, thateveryone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinarygifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she wasbeautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteenshe was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroadthrough all the villages around—but why do I say the villages around,merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way intothe halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, whocame from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious,or some wonder-working image?Her father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there areno locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better thanher own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of thedaughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for awife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich ajewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of hercountless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many whofelt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I wasof the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich inpossessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of thesame place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made herfather’s choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of ushis daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state ofperplexity he resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is thename of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting thatas we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughterto choose according to her inclination—a course that is worthy ofimitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. Ido not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what iscontemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what isgood and then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do notknow which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both off withthe tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound himnor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio—thatyou may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy,the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see itmust be disastrous.About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, theson of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente havingreturned from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. Acaptain who chanced to pass that way with his company had carried himoff from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and nowtwelve years later the young man came back in a soldier’s uniform,arrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and finesteel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow inanother; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.The peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they havenothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note ofhis finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he hadthree suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match;but he made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that ifthey had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made adisplay of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do notlook upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalledfor or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. Heused to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza,and there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories hetold us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globehe had not seen, nor battle he had not been engaged in; he had killedmore Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more singlecombats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego García deParedes and a thousand others he named, and out of all he had comevictorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showedmarks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said weregunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, withmonstrous impudence he used to say “you” to his equals and even thosewho knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and hisdeeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the kinghimself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of amusician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said hemade it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he wassomething of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the townhe made a ballad a league long.c51b.jpg (372K)Full SizeThis soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca,this bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched byLeandra from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. Theglitter of his showy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her(for he gave away twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of hisexploits which he told about himself came to her ears; and in short, asthe devil no doubt had arranged it, she fell in love with him beforethe presumption of making love to her had suggested itself to him; andas in love-affairs none are more easily brought to an issue than thosewhich have the inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicentecame to an understanding without any difficulty; and before any of hernumerous suitors had any suspicion of her design, she had alreadycarried it into effect, having left the house of her dearly belovedfather (for mother she had none), and disappeared from the village withthe soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than outof any of the large number he laid claim to. All the village and allwho heard of it were amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmothunderstruck, her father full of grief, her relations indignant, theauthorities all in a ferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms.They scoured the roads, they searched the woods and all quarters, andat the end of three days they found the flighty Leandra in a mountaincave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all the money and preciousjewels she had carried away from home with her.c51c.jpg (275K)Full SizeThey brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as toher misfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de laRoca had deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had inducedher to leave her father’s house, as he meant to take her to the richestand most delightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and thatshe, ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father,and handed over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he hadcarried her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the cave wherethey had found her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, withoutrobbing her of her honour, had taken from her everything she had, andmade off, leaving her in the cave, a thing that still further surprisedeverybody. It was not easy for us to credit the young man’s continence,but she asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to console herdistressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken since thejewel that once lost can never be recovered had been left to hisdaughter. The same day that Leandra made her appearance her fatherremoved her from our sight and took her away to shut her up in aconvent in a town near this, in the hope that time may wear away someof the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra’s youth furnished an excusefor her fault, at least with those to whom it was of no consequencewhether she was good or bad; but those who knew her shrewdness andintelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour to ignorance but towantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is for the mostpart flighty and ill-regulated.Leandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo’s eyes grew blind, or at any ratefound nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were indarkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyablewhile Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grewless; we cursed the soldier’s finery and railed at the carelessness ofLeandra’s father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village andcome to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own,and I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees,giving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra’spraises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heavenpouring forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, manymore of Leandra’s lovers have come to these rude mountains and adoptedour mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy theplace had been turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it ofshepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the name ofthe fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her and calls hercapricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her as frailand frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and revilesher; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and in shortall abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this generalinfatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn withoutever having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail andmourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyonecause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before herpassion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shadebeneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woesto the breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name ofLeandra; the mountains ring with “Leandra,” “Leandra” murmur thebrooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hopingwithout hope and fearing without knowing what we fear. Of all thissilly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is myrival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain of, he onlycomplains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which heplays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show hisingenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, andthat is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, theirdouble dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and inshort the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections andinclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions Imade use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is afemale I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all myfold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have beentedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is closeby, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a varietyof toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.c51e.jpg (14K)CHAPTER LII.OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITHTHE RARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEATHE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSIONc52a.jpg (40K)Full SizeThe goatherd’s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and thecanon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particularattention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike themanner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished citywit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in sayingthat the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services toEugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was DonQuixote, who said to him, “Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I foundmyself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this veryinstant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from thatconvent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of theabbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in yourhands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing,however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of anykind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our Lord thatthe might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but thatthe power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and thenI promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by myprofession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak andneedy.”The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote’s sorry appearance andlooks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was nexthim, “Señor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in sucha strain?”“Who should it be,” said the barber, “but the famous Don Quixote of LaMancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protectorof damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?”“That,” said the goatherd, “sounds like what one reads in the books ofthe knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though itis my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman hasempty lodgings in his head.”“You are a great scoundrel,” said Don Quixote, “and it is you who areempty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch thatbore you;” and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf thatwas near him and sent it full in the goatherd’s face, with such forcethat he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understandjokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, payingno respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote,and seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt havethrottled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue,and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table, smashingplates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything onit. Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of thegoatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked bySancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives totake a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however,prevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixoteunder him, and rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs thatthe poor knight’s face streamed with blood as freely as his own. Thecanon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers werecapering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on asthey do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone wasfrantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of thecanon’s servants, who kept him from going to his master’s assistance.c52b.jpg (348K)Full SizeAt last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruiserswho were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard atrumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in thedirection whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was mostexcited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against hiswill he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty wellpummelled, said to him, “Brother devil (for it is impossible but thatthou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough toovercome mine), I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for thesolemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me tosummon me to some new adventure.” The goatherd, who was by this timetired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and DonQuixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter wherethe sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hillseveral men clad in white like penitents.The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture fromthe earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organisingprocessions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the handsof his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a villagethat was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there wason one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb ofthe penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, tookit into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell tohim alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the moreconfirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in blackthey had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains anddiscourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as thisoccurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing atlarge, and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, hehad him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword hemounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voiceexclaimed to those who stood by, “Now, noble company, ye shall see howimportant it is that there should be knights in the world professingthe order of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by thedeliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whetherknights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,” and so saying hebrought his legs to bear on Rocinante—for he had no spurs—and at a fullcanter (for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinantefairly galloping) set off to encounter the penitents, though thecurate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out oftheir power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of Sancho callingafter him, “Where are you going, Señor Don Quixote? What devils havepossessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me!mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are carryingon that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Takecare what you are doing, señor, for this time it may be safely said youdon’t know what you are about.” Sancho laboured in vain, for his masterwas so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures andreleasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and even hadhe heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him. Hecame up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was alreadyanxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excitedvoice he exclaimed, “You who hide your faces, perhaps because you arenot good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to sayto you.” The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, andone of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck bythe strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and theother ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him,“Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for thesebrethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is itreasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is shortenough to be said in two words.”“I will say it in one,” replied Don Quixote, “and it is this; that atonce, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sadaspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, andthat ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, whowas born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will notpermit you to advance another step until you have restored to her theliberty she pines for and deserves.”From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman,and began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder onDon Quixote’s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he madea rush at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burdento his comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick thathe had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caughta mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but withthe portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on theshoulder of Don Quixote’s sword arm (which the buckler could notprotect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to theground in a sad plight.Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing,seeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again,for he was a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all thedays of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho’sshouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; andso, fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic underhis girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer.By this time all Don Quixote’s companions had come up to where he lay;but the processionists seeing them come running, and with them theofficers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped theirscourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive againsttheir assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matterbetter than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself onhis master’s body, raising over him the most doleful and laughablelamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. Thecurate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, andtheir recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of bothparties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixotewas, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poorgentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in hiseyes, “Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast endedthe course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour andglory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of theewill be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for theirmisdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for onlyeight months of service thou hast given me the best island the seagirds or surrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble,encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason,imitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, inshort, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!”c52c.jpg (325K)Full SizeAt the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and thefirst word he said was, “He who lives separated from you, sweetestDulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friendSancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition topress the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked topieces.”“That I will do with all my heart, señor,” said Sancho; “and let usreturn to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, andthere we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out moreprofitable and creditable to us.”“Thou art right, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote; “It will be wise to letthe malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.”The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wiselyin doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza’ssimplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. Theprocession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of theBrotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them whatwas due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how DonQuixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered fromit, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they allseparated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and thebarber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regardedeverything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yokedhis oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at hisusual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the endof six days they reached Don Quixote’s village, and entered it aboutthe middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and thepeople were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote’s cart passed.They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognisedtheir townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off tobring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master anduncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hayon an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladiesraised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictionson those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when theysaw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.At the news of Don Quixote’s arrival Sancho Panza’s wife came running,for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him ashis squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was ifthe ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his masterwas.“Thanks be to God,” said she, “for being so good to me; but now tellme, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have youbrought me back? What shoes for your children?”“I bring nothing of that sort, wife,” said Sancho; “though I bringother things of more consequence and value.”“I am very glad of that,” returned his wife; “show me these things ofmore value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheermy heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you havebeen away.”“I will show them to you at home, wife,” said Sancho; “be content forthe present; for if it please God that we should again go on ourtravels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, orgovernor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but thebest that is to be had.”“Heaven grant it, husband,” said she, “for indeed we have need of it.But tell me, what’s this about islands, for I don’t understand it?”“Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,” returned Sancho; “all in goodtime thou shalt see, wife—nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyselfcalled ‘your ladyship’ by all thy vassals.”“What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, andvassals?” returned Teresa Panza—for so Sancho’s wife was called, thoughthey were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives totake their husbands’ surnames.“Don’t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,” said Sancho; “itis enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But Imay tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the worldmore delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to aknight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those onefinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience,for out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still,for all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what mayhappen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visitingcastles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take themaravedi to pay.”While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, DonQuixote’s housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laidhim in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out wherehe was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make heruncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make hisescape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do tobring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices andrenewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and imploredheaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midstof the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dreadlest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment hefound himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.But the author of this history, though he has devoted research andindustry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in histhird sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them,at any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merelypreserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, thethird time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa,where he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city,and that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and highintelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, norwould he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had notproduced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leadenbox, which, according to his account, had been discovered among thecrumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt;in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothiccharacter, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements,and setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, thefidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself,together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character;but all that could be read and deciphered were those which thetrustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents.And the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in returnfor the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching theManchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they givehim the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalrythat pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he willconsider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouragedto seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at leastequal in invention and not less entertaining. The first words writtenon the parchment found in the leaden box were these:THE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA,A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA,ON THE LIFE AND DEATH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA,HOC SCRIPSERUNTMONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,ON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTEEPITAPHThe scatterbrain that gave La Mancha moreRich spoils than Jason’s; who a point so keenHad to his wit, and happier far had beenIf his wit’s weathercock a blunter bore;The arm renowned far as Gaeta’s shore,Cathay, and all the lands that lie between;The muse discreet and terrible in mienAs ever wrote on brass in days of yore;He who surpassed the Amadises all,And who as naught the Galaors accounted,Supported by his love and gallantry:Who made the Belianises sing small,And sought renown on Rocinante mounted;Here, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.PANIAGUADO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,IN LAUDEM DULCINEAE DEL TOBOSOSONNETShe, whose full features may be here descried,High-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain,Is Dulcinea, she for whom in vainThe great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed.For her, Toboso’s queen, from side to sideHe traversed the grim sierra, the champaignOf Aranjuez, and Montiel’s famous plain:On Rocinante oft a weary ride.Malignant planets, cruel destiny,Pursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame,And the unconquered star of chivalry.Nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claimOf death; he paid love’s bitter penalty,And left the marble to preserve his name.CAPRICHOSO, A MOST ACUTE ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,IN PRAISE OF ROCINANTE, STEED OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHASONNETOn that proud throne of diamantine sheen,Which the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade,The mad Manchegan’s banner now hath beenBy him in all its bravery displayed.There hath he hung his arms and trenchant bladeWherewith, achieving deeds till now unseen,He slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath madeA novel style for our new paladin.If Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul,If by his progeny the fame of GreeceThrough all the regions of the earth be spread,Great Quixote crowned in grim Bellona’s hallTo-day exalts La Mancha over these,And above Greece or Gaul she holds her head.Nor ends his glory here, for his good steedDoth Brillador and Bayard far exceed;As mettled steeds compared with Rocinante,The reputation they have won is scanty.BURLADOR, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,ON SANCHO PANZASONNETThe worthy Sancho Panza here you see;A great soul once was in that body small,Nor was there squire upon this earthly ballSo plain and simple, or of guile so free.Within an ace of being Count was he,And would have been but for the spite and gallOf this vile age, mean and illiberal,That cannot even let a donkey be.For mounted on an ass (excuse the word),By Rocinante’s side this gentle squireWas wont his wandering master to attend.Delusive hopes that lure the common herdWith promises of ease, the heart’s desire,In shadows, dreams, and smoke ye always end.CACHIDIABLO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,ON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTEEPITAPHThe knight lies here below,Ill-errant and bruised sore,Whom Rocinante boreIn his wanderings to and fro.By the side of the knight is laidStolid man Sancho too,Than whom a squire more trueWas not in the esquire trade.TIQUITOC, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,ON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA DEL TOBOSOEPITAPHHere Dulcinea lies.Plump was she and robust:Now she is ashes and dust:The end of all flesh that dies.A lady of high degree,With the port of a lofty dame,And the great Don Quixote’s flame,And the pride of her village was she.These were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, thewriting being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the Academiciansto make out their meaning conjecturally.

Now I say that “with his spurs, he ison his way.” Should he reach destination methinks I shall have renderedsome service to Your Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to sendhim off, so as to dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another DonQuixote who, under the name of Second Part, has run masqueradingthrough the whole world. And he who has shown the greatest longing forhim has been the great Emperor of China, who wrote me a letter inChinese a month ago and sent it by a special courier. He asked me, orto be truthful, he begged me to send him Don Quixote, for he intendedto found a college where the Spanish tongue would be taught, and it washis wish that the book to be read should be the History of Don Quixote.He also added that I should go and be the rector of this college. Iasked the bearer if His Majesty had afforded a sum in aid of my travelexpenses. He answered, “No, not even in thought.”“Then, brother,” I replied, “you can return to your China, post hasteor at whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not fit for so long atravel and, besides being ill, I am very much without money, whileEmperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples the greatCount of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges andrectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than Ican wish for.”Thus I gave him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering YourExcellency the “Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,” a book I shallfinish within four months, Deo volente, and which will be either theworst or the best that has been composed in our language, I mean ofthose intended for entertainment; at which I repent of having called itthe worst, for, in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain thesummit of possible quality. May Your Excellency return in such healththat is wished you; Persiles will be ready to kiss your hand and I yourfeet, being as I am, Your Excellency’s most humble servant.From Madrid, this last day of October of the year one thousand sixhundred and fifteen.At the service of Your Excellency:MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRATHE AUTHOR’S PREFACEpart2.jpg (130K)Full SizeGod bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly mustthou be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find thereretaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second DonQuixote—I mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and bornat Tarragona! Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee thatsatisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, inmine the rule must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call himass, fool, and malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offencebe his punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there’s an end ofit. What I cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with beingold and one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time frompassing over me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about insome tavern, and not on the grandest occasion the past or present hasseen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to thebeholder’s eye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation ofthose who know where they were received; for the soldier shows togreater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight; and so stronglyis this my feeling, that if now it were proposed to perform animpossibility for me, I would rather have had my share in that mightyaction, than be free from my wounds this minute without having beenpresent at it. Those the soldier shows on his face and breast are starsthat direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of meritedpraise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with greyhairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that commonlyimproves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me envious,and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for really andtruly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which is holy,noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likely toattack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the rank offamiliar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on account ofhim on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely mistaken; for Iworship the genius of that person, and admire his works and hisunceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to thisgentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are more satiricalthan exemplary, but that they are good; for they could not be thatunless there was a little of everything in them.I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, andkeeping myself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from afeeling that additional suffering should not be inflicted upon asufferer, and that what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless bevery great, as he does not dare to come out into the open field andbroad daylight, but hides his name and disguises his country as if hehad been guilty of some lese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst cometo know him, tell him from me that I do not hold myself aggrieved; forI know well what the temptations of the devil are, and that one of thegreatest is putting it into a man’s head that he can write and print abook by which he will get as much fame as money, and as much money asfame; and to prove it I will beg of you, in your own sprightly,pleasant way, to tell him this story.There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollestabsurdities and vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. Itwas this: he made a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dogin the street, or wherever it might be, he with his foot held one ofits legs fast, and with his hand lifted up the other, and as best hecould fixed the tube where, by blowing, he made the dog as round as aball; then holding it in this position, he gave it a couple of slaps onthe belly, and let it go, saying to the bystanders (and there werealways plenty of them): “Do your worships think, now, that it is aneasy thing to blow up a dog?”—Does your worship think now, that it isan easy thing to write a book?And if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell himthis one, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a pieceof marble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and whenhe came upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let theweight fall right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barkingand howling, would run three streets without stopping. It so happened,however, that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was acap-maker’s dog, of which his master was very fond. The stone came downhitting it on the head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the mastersaw the affair and was wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushedout at the madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body, and atevery stroke he gave him he said, “You dog, you thief! my lurcher!Don’t you see, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?” and so, repeatingthe word “lurcher” again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to ajelly. The madman took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for morethan a month never once showed himself in public; but after that hecame out again with his old trick and a heavier load than ever. He cameup to where there was a dog, and examining it very carefully withoutventuring to let the stone fall, he said: “This is a lurcher; ware!” Inshort, all the dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, hesaid were lurchers; and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will bethe same with this historian; that he will not venture another time todischarge the weight of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harderthan stones. Tell him, too, that I do not care a farthing for thethreat he holds out to me of depriving me of my profit by means of hisbook; for, to borrow from the famous interlude of “The Perendenga,” Isay in answer to him, “Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, andChrist be with us all.” Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whoseChristian charity and well-known generosity support me against all thestrokes of my curst fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolenceof His Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and whatmatter if there be no printing-presses in the world, or if they printmore books against me than there are letters in the verses of MingoRevulgo! These two princes, unsought by any adulation or flattery ofmine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them to show mekindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier andricher than if Fortune had raised me to her greatest height in theordinary way. The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious;poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether;and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it bethrough the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of loftyand noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou needst sayno more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell theeto bear in mind that this Second Part of “Don Quixote” which I offerthee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First,and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at length deadand buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any furtherevidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient; andsuffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given anaccount of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into thematter again; for abundance, even of good things, prevents them frombeing valued; and scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers acertain value. I was forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expectthe “Persiles,” which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of“Galatea.”part2e.jpg (37K)CHAPTER I.OF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUTHIS MALADYp01a.jpg (156K)Full SizeCide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and thirdsally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remainednearly a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bringback to his recollection what had taken place. They did not, however,omit to visit his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be carefulto treat him with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, andsuch as were good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain tosee, all his misfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper repliedthat they did so, and meant to do so with all possible care andassiduity, for they could perceive that their master was now and thenbeginning to show signs of being in his right mind. This gave greatsatisfaction to the curate and the barber, for they concluded they hadtaken the right course in carrying him off enchanted on the ox-cart, ashas been described in the First Part of this great as well as accuratehistory, in the last chapter thereof. So they resolved to pay him avisit and test the improvement in his condition, although they thoughtit almost impossible that there could be any; and they agreed not totouch upon any point connected with knight-errantry so as not to runthe risk of reopening wounds which were still so tender.They came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in agreen baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and driedup that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were verycordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and hetalked to them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosenlanguage. In the course of their conversation they fell to discussingwhat they call State-craft and systems of government, correcting thisabuse and condemning that, reforming one practice and abolishinganother, each of the three setting up for a new legislator, a modernLycurgus, or a brand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel theState, that they seemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken outsomething quite different from what they had put in; and on all thesubjects they dealt with, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense thatthe pair of examiners were fully convinced that he was quite recoveredand in his full senses.The niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and couldnot find words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing theirmaster so clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his originalplan, which was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved totest Don Quixote’s recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuineor not; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk ofthe news that had come from the capital, and, among other things, hesaid it was considered certain that the Turk was coming down with apowerful fleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when thegreat storm would burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehensionof this, which almost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majestyhad made provision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicilyand the island of Malta.To this Don Quixote replied, “His Majesty has acted like a prudentwarrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that theenemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I wouldrecommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, hisMajesty is very far from thinking of.”The moment the curate heard this he said to himself, “God keep thee inhis hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitatingthyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thysimplicity.”But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked DonQuixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said oughtto be adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have tobe added to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that peoplewere in the habit of offering to princes.“Mine, master shaver,” said Don Quixote, “will not be impertinent, but,on the contrary, pertinent.”“I don’t mean that,” said the barber, “but that experience has shownthat all or most of the expedients which are proposed to his Majestyare either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to thekingdom.”“Mine, however,” replied Don Quixote, “is neither impossible norabsurd, but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest and mostexpeditious that could suggest itself to any projector’s mind.”“You take a long time to tell it, Señor Don Quixote,” said the curate.“I don’t choose to tell it here, now,” said Don Quixote, “and have itreach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and someother carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.”“For my part,” said the barber, “I give my word here and before Godthat I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthlyman—an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in theprelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundredgold crowns and his pacing mule.”“I am not versed in stories,” said Don Quixote; “but I know the oath isa good one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.”“Even if he were not,” said the curate, “I will go bail and answer forhim that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain ofpaying any penalty that may be pronounced.”“And who will be security for you, señor curate?” said Don Quixote.“My profession,” replied the curate, “which is to keep secrets.”“Ods body!” said Don Quixote at this, “what more has his Majesty to dobut to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that arescattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, foreven if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them whoalone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk. Give meyour attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a singleknight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as ifthey all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me,how many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in anevil hour for me: I don’t speak for anyone else) the famous DonBelianis were alive now, or anyone of the innumerable progeny of Amadisof Gaul! If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to facewith the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk’schance. But God will have regard for his people, and will providesomeone, who, if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at leastwill not be inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, andI say no more.”“Alas!” exclaimed the niece at this, “may I die if my master does notwant to turn knight-errant again;” to which Don Quixote replied, “Aknight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when helikes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knowswhat I mean.” But here the barber said, “I ask your worships to give meleave to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville,which comes so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatlyto tell it.” Don Quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared tolisten, and he began thus:“In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations hadplaced there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna incanon law; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion ofmost people that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate,after some years of confinement, took it into his head that he was saneand in his full senses, and under this impression wrote to theArchbishop, entreating him earnestly, and in very correct language, tohave him released from the misery in which he was living; for by God’smercy he had now recovered his lost reason, though his relations, inorder to enjoy his property, kept him there, and, in spite of thetruth, would make him out to be mad until his dying day. TheArchbishop, moved by repeated sensible, well-written letters, directedone of his chaplains to make inquiry of the madhouse as to the truth ofthe licentiate’s statements, and to have an interview with the madmanhimself, and, if it should appear that he was in his senses, to takehim out and restore him to liberty. The chaplain did so, and thegovernor assured him that the man was still mad, and that though heoften spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would in the end breakout into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalanced all thesensible things he had said before, as might be easily tested bytalking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, andobtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more,during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that wasincoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally thatthe chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane. Among otherthings, he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presentshis relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucidintervals; and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was hislarge property; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged andthrew doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him froma brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such a way that he castsuspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear covetous andheartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to takehim away with him that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain forhimself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, theworthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which thelicentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor again badehim beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubtstill mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing todissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing thatit was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed thelicentiate in his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soonas he saw himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of theappearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charityto go and take leave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said hewould go with him to see what madmen there were in the house; so theywent upstairs, and with them some of those who were present.Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just atthat moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him, ‘Brother, thinkif you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has beenpleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine,to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in my senses, for withGod’s power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him,for as he has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he willrestore you if you trust in him. I will take care to send you some goodthings to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have you know I amconvinced, as one who has gone through it, that all this madness ofours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind.Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks downhealth and brings on death.’“To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage oppositethat of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from anold mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who itwas that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiateanswered, ‘It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remainhere any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that hashad so great mercy upon me.’“‘Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don’t let the devil deceiveyou,’ replied the madman. ‘Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you willsave yourself the trouble of coming back.’“‘I know I am cured,’ returned the licentiate, ‘and that I shall nothave to go stations again.’“‘You cured!’ said the madman; ‘well, we shall see; God be with you;but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, thatfor this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasingyou from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, Ishall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered forages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable littlelicentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer,who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wontto threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punishthis ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any partof its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckonedfrom the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thoucured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will assoon think of sending rain as of hanging myself.“Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of themadman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him bythe hands, said to him, ‘Be not uneasy, señor; attach no importance towhat this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain,I, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as oftenas it pleases me and may be needful.’“The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter thechaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, ‘For all that, SeñorNeptune, it will not do to vex Señor Jupiter; remain where you are, andsome other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, wewill come back for you.’ So they stripped the licentiate, and he wasleft where he was; and that’s the end of the story.”“So that’s the story, master barber,” said Don Quixote, “which came inso pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it? Mastershaver, master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve.Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit,valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are alwaysodious and unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of thewaters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I amnot one. My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake itmakes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order ofknight-errantry was in the field. But our depraved age does not deserveto enjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant tookupon their shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection ofdamsels, the succour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of theproud, and the recompense of the humble. With the knights of thesedays, for the most part, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffsthey wear, that rustle as they go, not the chain mail of their armour;no knight now-a-days sleeps in the open field exposed to the inclemencyof heaven, and in full panoply from head to foot; no one now takes anap, as they call it, without drawing his feet out of the stirrups, andleaning upon his lance, as the knights-errant used to do; no one now,issuing from the wood, penetrates yonder mountains, and then treads thebarren, lonely shore of the sea—mostly a tempestuous and stormy one—andfinding on the beach a little bark without oars, sail, mast, ortackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of his heart flings himselfinto it and commits himself to the wrathful billows of the deep sea,that one moment lift him up to heaven and the next plunge him into thedepths; and opposing his breast to the irresistible gale, findshimself, when he least expects it, three thousand leagues and more awayfrom the place where he embarked; and leaping ashore in a remote andunknown land has adventures that deserve to be written, not onparchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs over energy, indolenceover exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over courage, and theoryover practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in the goldenages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more virtuous and morevaliant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more discreet than Palmerinof England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco? Who morecourtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more slashed or slashing than DonBelianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more ready to facedanger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more sincere than Esplandian?Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who more bold thanRodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino? Who more daring thanReinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who more gallant andcourteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the presentday are descended, according to Turpin in his ‘Cosmography.’ All theseknights, and many more that I could name, señor curate, wereknights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or such asthese, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his Majestywould find himself well served and would save great expense, and theTurk would be left tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am, asthe chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber hastold us, will not send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please.I say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him.”“Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,” said the barber, “I did not mean it inthat way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worshipought not to be vexed.”“As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,” returned Don Quixote, “Imyself am the best judge.”Hereupon the curate observed, “I have hardly said a word as yet; and Iwould gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote hassaid, that worries and works my conscience.”“The señor curate has leave for more than that,” returned Don Quixote,“so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt onone’s conscience.”“Well then, with that permission,” said the curate, “I say my doubt isthat, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack ofknights-errant you, Señor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really andtruly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on thecontrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, anddreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.”“That is another mistake,” replied Don Quixote, “into which many havefallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in theworld, and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions,tried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth.Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have,supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clearthat I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, whowas a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome thoughblack beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression,sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; andas I have depicted Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describeall the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; forby the perception I have that they were what their histories describe,and by the deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it ispossible, with the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features,complexion, and stature.”“How big, in your worship’s opinion, may the giant Morgante have been,Señor Don Quixote?” asked the barber.“With regard to giants,” replied Don Quixote, “opinions differ as towhether there ever were any or not in the world; but the HolyScripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us thatthere were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine,Goliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a hugesize. Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been foundleg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain thattheir owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry putsthis fact beyond a doubt. But, for all that, I cannot speak withcertainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect he cannot havebeen very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I findin the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned, that hefrequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him, itis clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive.”“That is true,” said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment ofhearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the featuresof Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the TwelvePeers of France, for they were all knights-errant.“As for Reinaldos,” replied Don Quixote, “I venture to say that he wasbroad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominenteyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society ofthieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, orOrlando (for the histories call him by all these names), I am ofopinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered,rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy bodyand a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but verypolite and well-bred.”“If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship hasdescribed,” said the curate, “it is no wonder that the fair LadyAngelica rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, andgrace of that budding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrenderedherself; and she showed her sense in falling in love with the gentlesoftness of Medoro rather than the roughness of Roland.”“That Angelica, señor curate,” returned Don Quixote, “was a giddydamsel, flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as full ofher vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn athousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with asmooth-faced sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except suchreputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got forhim. The great poet who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caringto sing her adventures after her contemptible surrender (which probablywere not over and above creditable), dropped her where he says:How she received the sceptre of Cathay,Some bard of defter quill may sing some day;and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called_vates_, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; forsince then a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears,and another famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.”“Tell me, Señor Don Quixote,” said the barber here, “among all thosewho praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on this LadyAngelica?”“I can well believe,” replied Don Quixote, “that if Sacripante orRoland had been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming; forit is naturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejectedby their ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom theyselect as the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in satiresand libels—a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but upto the present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against theLady Angelica, who turned the world upside down.”“Strange,” said the curate; but at this moment they heard thehousekeeper and the niece, who had previously withdrawn from theconversation, exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise theyall ran out.p01e.jpg (15K)CHAPTER II.WHICH TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DONQUIXOTE’S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERSp02a.jpg (159K)Full SizeThe history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and thebarber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming toSancho, who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote whilethey held the door against him, “What does the vagabond want in thishouse? Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else,that delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping aboutthe country.”To which Sancho replied, “Devil’s own housekeeper! it is I who amdeluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and notthy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightilymistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me anisland, which I am still waiting for.”“May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,” said the niece;“What are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser thatthou art?”“It is not something to eat,” replied Sancho, “but something to governand rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court.”“For all that,” said the housekeeper, “you don’t enter here, you bag ofmischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig yourseed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.”The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words ofthe three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurtout a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points thatmight not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the othertwo hold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and thecurate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whoserecovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazyideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; andsaid the curate to the barber, “You will see, gossip, that when we areleast thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for anotherflight.”“I have no doubt of it,” returned the barber; “but I do not wonder somuch at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire,who has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I supposeall the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of hishead.”“God help them,” said the curate; “and let us be on the look-out to seewhat comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for itseems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madnessof the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth afarthing.”“That is true,” said the barber, “and I should like very much to knowwhat the pair are talking about at this moment.”“I promise you,” said the curate, “the niece or the housekeeper willtell us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen.”Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and whenthey were alone he said to him, “It grieves me greatly, Sancho, thatthou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thycottage, when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We salliedforth together, we took the road together, we wandered abroad together;we have had the same fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed theeonce, they belaboured me a hundred times, and that is the onlyadvantage I have of thee.”“That was only reasonable,” replied Sancho, “for, by what your worshipsays, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to theirsquires.”“Thou art mistaken, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “according to the maxim_quando caput dolet_, etc.”“I don’t understand any language but my own,” said Sancho.“I mean to say,” said Don Quixote, “that when the head suffers all themembers suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am thy head, andthou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil thataffects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects theegive pain to me.”“It should be so,” said Sancho; “but when I was blanketed as a member,my head was on the other side of the wall, looking on while I wasflying through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if themembers are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should beobliged to feel their sufferings.”“Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that I did notfeel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not say soor think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst inbody. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall haveopportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? Whatdo the common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do thecaballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of mycourtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving andrestoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears onthis subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to thegood or taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyalvassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in itsproper shape, not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deferenceto lessen it. And I would have thee know, Sancho, that if the nakedtruth, undisguised by flattery, came to the ears of princes, timeswould be different, and other ages would be reckoned iron ages morethan ours, which I hold to be the golden of these latter days. Profitby this advice, Sancho, and report to me clearly and faithfully thetruth of what thou knowest touching what I have demanded of thee.”“That I will do with all my heart, master,” replied Sancho, “providedyour worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wish me to say itout in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it thanit came to my knowledge in.”“I will not be vexed at all,” returned Don Quixote; “thou mayest speakfreely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.”“Well then,” said he, “first of all, I have to tell you that the commonpeople consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me no less afool. The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of yourquality of gentleman, you have assumed the ‘Don,’ and made a knight ofyourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres ofland, and never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they do notwant to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularlysquire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their blackstockings with green silk.”“That,” said Don Quixote, “does not apply to me, for I always go welldressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more from thewear and tear of arms than of time.”“As to your worship’s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task,there is a variety of opinions. Some say, ‘mad but droll;’ others,‘valiant but unlucky;’ others, ‘courteous but meddling,’ and then theygo into such a number of things that they don’t leave a whole boneeither in your worship or in myself.”“Recollect, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that wherever virtue exists inan eminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of the famous men thathave lived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius Cæsar, theboldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with beingambitious, and not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in hismorals. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they saythat he was somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the manylabours, it is said that he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, thebrother of Amadis of Gaul, it was whispered that he wasover-quarrelsome, and of his brother that he was lachrymose. So that, OSancho, amongst all these calumnies against good men, mine may be letpass, since they are no more than thou hast said.”“That’s just where it is, body of my father!”“Is there more, then?” asked Don Quixote.“There’s the tail to be skinned yet,” said Sancho; “all so far is cakesand fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about thecalumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant whocan tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last nightthe son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca,came home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to welcomehim, he told me that your worship’s history is already abroad in books,with the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; andhe says they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho Panza, and thelady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to uswhen we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how thehistorian who wrote them down could have known them.”“I promise thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “the author of our historywill be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose towrite about is hidden.”“What!” said Sancho, “a sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor SamsonCarrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says the author of thehistory is called Cide Hamete Berengena.”“That is a Moorish name,” said Don Quixote.“May be so,” replied Sancho; “for I have heard say that the Moors aremostly great lovers of berengenas.”“Thou must have mistaken the surname of this ‘Cide’—which means inArabic ‘Lord’—Sancho,” observed Don Quixote.“Very likely,” replied Sancho, “but if your worship wishes me to fetchthe bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.”“Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “forwhat thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall not eat a morsel thatwill agree with me until I have heard all about it.”“Then I am off for him,” said Sancho; and leaving his master he went inquest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time, and, allthree together, they had a very droll colloquy.p02e.jpg (23K)CHAPTER III.OF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHOPANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCOp03a.jpg (131K)Full SizeDon Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelorCarrasco, from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into abook as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any suchhistory could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he hadslain was not yet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted tomake out that his mighty achievements were going about in print. Forall that, he fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, bythe aid of magic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in orderto magnify and exalt them above the most famous ever achieved by anyknight-errant; if an enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade thembelow the meanest ever recorded of any low squire, though as he said tohimself, the achievements of squires never were recorded. If, however,it were the fact that such a history were in existence, it mustnecessarily, being the story of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent,lofty, imposing, grand and true. With this he comforted himselfsomewhat, though it made him uncomfortable to think that the author wasa Moor, judging by the title of “Cide;” and that no truth was to belooked for from Moors, as they are all impostors, cheats, and schemers.He was afraid he might have dealt with his love affairs in someindecorous fashion, that might tend to the discredit and prejudice ofthe purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he would have had him setforth the fidelity and respect he had always observed towards her,spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all sorts, and keeping incheck the impetuosity of his natural impulses. Absorbed and wrapped upin these and divers other cogitations, he was found by Sancho andCarrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great courtesy.The bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but verysharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with around face, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of amischievous disposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this hegave a sample as soon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his kneesbefore him and saying, “Let me kiss your mightiness’s hand, Señor DonQuixote of La Mancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear,though I have no more than the first four orders, your worship is oneof the most famous knights-errant that have ever been, or will be, allthe world over. A blessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has writtenthe history of your great deeds, and a double blessing on thatconnoisseur who took the trouble of having it translated out of theArabic into our Castilian vulgar tongue for the universal entertainmentof the people!”Don Quixote made him rise, and said, “So, then, it is true that thereis a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?”“So true is it, señor,” said Samson, “that my belief is there are morethan twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this veryday. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have beenprinted, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed atAntwerp, and I am persuaded there will not be a country or language inwhich there will not be a translation of it.”“One of the things,” here observed Don Quixote, “that ought to givemost pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in hislifetime in print and in type, familiar in people’s mouths with a goodname; I say with a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there isno death to be compared to it.”“If it goes by good name and fame,” said the bachelor, “your worshipalone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the Moor inhis own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to setbefore us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers,your fortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well aswounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worshipand my lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso—”“I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Doña,” observed Sancho here;“nothing more than the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; so here already thehistory is wrong.”“That is not an objection of any importance,” replied Carrasco.“Certainly not,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me, señor bachelor, whatdeeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?”“On that point,” replied the bachelor, “opinions differ, as tastes do;some swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took tobe Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; onecries up the description of the two armies that afterwards took theappearance of two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on itsway to be buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galleyslaves is the best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to theaffair with the Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiantBiscayan.”“Tell me, señor bachelor,” said Sancho at this point, “does theadventure with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante wenthankering after dainties?”“The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,” replied Samson; “hetells all and sets down everything, even to the capers that worthySancho cut in the blanket.”“I cut no capers in the blanket,” returned Sancho; “in the air I did,and more of them than I liked.”“There is no human history in the world, I suppose,” said Don Quixote,“that has not its ups and downs, but more than others such as deal withchivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperousadventures.”“For all that,” replied the bachelor, “there are those who have readthe history who say they would have been glad if the author had leftout some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on Señor DonQuixote in various encounters.”“That’s where the truth of the history comes in,” said Sancho.“At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,”observed Don Quixote; “for there is no need of recording events whichdo not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bringthe hero of it into contempt. Æneas was not in truth and earnest sopious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describeshim.”“That is true,” said Samson; “but it is one thing to write as a poet,another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things,not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian hasto write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were,without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.”“Well then,” said Sancho, “if this señor Moor goes in for telling thetruth, no doubt among my master’s drubbings mine are to be found; forthey never took the measure of his worship’s shoulders without doingthe same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for,as my master himself says, the members must share the pain of thehead.”“You are a sly dog, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “i’ faith, you have nowant of memory when you choose to remember.”“If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,” said Sancho, “myweals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs.”“Hush, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and don’t interrupt the bachelor,whom I entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in thishistory.”“And about me,” said Sancho, “for they say, too, that I am one of theprincipal presonages in it.”“Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,” said Samson.“What! Another word-catcher!” said Sancho; “if that’s to be the way weshall not make an end in a lifetime.”“May God shorten mine, Sancho,” returned the bachelor, “if you are notthe second person in the history, and there are even some who wouldrather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though thereare some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believingthere was any possibility in the government of that island offered youby Señor Don Quixote.”“There is still sunshine on the wall,” said Don Quixote; “and whenSancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience thatyears bring, he will be fitter and better qualified for being agovernor than he is at present.”“By God, master,” said Sancho, “the island that I cannot govern withthe years I have, I’ll not be able to govern with the years ofMethuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distancesomewhere, I know not where; and not that there is any want of head inme to govern it.”“Leave it to God, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for all will be andperhaps better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by God’swill.”“That is true,” said Samson; “and if it be God’s will, there will notbe any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho togovern.”“I have seen governors in these parts,” said Sancho, “that are not tobe compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called ‘yourlordship’ and served on silver.”“Those are not governors of islands,” observed Samson, “but of othergovernments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at leastknow grammar.”“I could manage the gram well enough,” said Sancho; “but for the mar Ihave neither leaning nor liking, for I don’t know what it is; butleaving this matter of the government in God’s hands, to send mewherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, señor bachelorSamson Carrasco, it has pleased me beyond measure that the author ofthis history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is saidof me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he hadsaid anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian,such as I am, the deaf would have heard of it.”“That would be working miracles,” said Samson.“Miracles or no miracles,” said Sancho, “let everyone mind how hespeaks or writes about people, and not set down at random the firstthing that comes into his head.”“One of the faults they find with this history,” said the bachelor, “isthat its author inserted in it a novel called ‘The Ill-advisedCuriosity;’ not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of placeand has nothing to do with the history of his worship Señor DonQuixote.”“I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,”said Sancho.“Then, I say,” said Don Quixote, “the author of my history was no sage,but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, setabout writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, thepainter of Úbeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he waspainting, answered, ‘What it may turn out.’ Sometimes he would paint acock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongsideof it in Gothic letters, ‘This is a cock;’ and so it will be with myhistory, which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.”“No fear of that,” returned Samson, “for it is so plain that there isnothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the youngpeople read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; ina word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of allsorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, ‘There goesRocinante.’ And those that are most given to reading it are the pages,for there is not a lord’s ante-chamber where there is not a ‘DonQuixote’ to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this onepounces upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said history isthe most delightful and least injurious entertainment that has beenhitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it even thesemblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other thanCatholic.”“To write in any other way,” said Don Quixote, “would not be to writetruth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehoodought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know notwhat could have led the author to have recourse to novels andirrelevant stories, when he had so much to write about in mine; nodoubt he must have gone by the proverb ‘with straw or with hay, &c.,’for by merely setting forth my thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my loftypurposes, my enterprises, he might have made a volume as large, orlarger than all the works of El Tostado would make up. In fact, theconclusion I arrive at, señor bachelor, is, that to write histories, orbooks of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripeunderstanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain ofgraceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverestcharacter in comedy is the clown, for he who would make people take himfor a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a sacred thing,for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God is; butnotwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling booksbroadcast on the world as if they were fritters.”“There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,” said thebachelor.“No doubt of that,” replied Don Quixote; “but it often happens thatthose who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation bytheir writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, whenthey give them to the press.”“The reason of that,” said Samson, “is, that as printed works areexamined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater thefame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men famousfor their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, ormost commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight andpleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having producedany of their own.”“That is no wonder,” said Don Quixote; “for there are many divines whoare no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects orexcesses of those who preach.”“All that is true, Señor Don Quixote,” said Carrasco; “but I wish suchfault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay somuch attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumbleat; for if _aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus_, they should remember howlong he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as littleshade as possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault withmay be moles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bearsthem; and so I say very great is the risk to which he who prints a bookexposes himself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to writeone that will satisfy and please all readers.”“That which treats of me must have pleased few,” said Don Quixote.“Quite the contrary,” said the bachelor; “for, as _stultorum infinitumest numerus_, innumerable are those who have relished the said history;but some have brought a charge against the author’s memory, inasmuch ashe forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho’s Dapple; for it isnot stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, thathe was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on thesame ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgotto state what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in thevalise in the Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, andthere are many who would be glad to know what he did with them, or whathe spent them on, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.”“Señor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts orexplanations,” said Sancho; “for there’s a sinking of the stomach comeover me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuffit will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at home, and myold woman is waiting for me; after dinner I’ll come back, and willanswer you and all the world every question you may choose to ask, aswell about the loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundredcrowns;” and without another word or waiting for a reply he made offhome.Don Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penancewith him. The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a coupleof young pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talkedchivalry, Carrasco fell in with his host’s humour, the banquet came toan end, they took their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and theirconversation was resumed.p03e.jpg (49K)CHAPTER IV.IN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS ANDQUESTIONS OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERSWORTH KNOWING AND TELLINGp04a.jpg (143K)Full SizeSancho came back to Don Quixote’s house, and returning to the latesubject of conversation, he said, “As to what Señor Samson said, thathe would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I sayin reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flyingfrom the Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galleyslaves, and the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, mymaster and I ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my masterleaning on his lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and wearywith the late frays we fell asleep as if it had been on four feathermattresses; and I in particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was,he was able to come and prop me up on four stakes, which he put underthe four corners of the pack-saddle in such a way that he left memounted on it, and took away Dapple from under me without my feelingit.”p04b.jpg (270K)Full Size“That is an easy matter,” said Don Quixote, “and it is no newoccurrence, for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege ofAlbracca; the famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took hishorse from between his legs.”“Day came,” continued Sancho, “and the moment I stirred the stakes gaveway and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; I looked aboutfor the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my eyes and Iraised such a lamentation that, if the author of our history has notput it in, he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing. Somedays after, I know not how many, travelling with her ladyship thePrincess Micomicona, I saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dressof a gipsy, was that Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascalthat my master and I freed from the chain.”“That is not where the mistake is,” replied Samson; “it is, that beforethe ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as being mounted onit.”“I don’t know what to say to that,” said Sancho, “unless that thehistorian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of theprinter’s.”“No doubt that’s it,” said Samson; “but what became of the hundredcrowns? Did they vanish?”To which Sancho answered, “I spent them for my own good, and my wife’s,and my children’s, and it is they that have made my wife bear sopatiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service ofmy master, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back tothe house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poorlook-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me,here I am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is noaffair of anyone’s whether I took or did not take, whether I spent ordid not spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys wereto be paid for in money, even if they were valued at no more than fourmaravedis apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half ofthem. Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, andblack white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.”“I will take care,” said Carrasco, “to impress upon the author of thehistory that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthySancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.”“Is there anything else to correct in the history, señor bachelor?”asked Don Quixote.“No doubt there is,” replied he; “but not anything that will be of thesame importance as those I have mentioned.”“Does the author promise a second part at all?” said Don Quixote.“He does promise one,” replied Samson; “but he says he has not foundit, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it willappear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second parthas ever been good, and others that enough has been already writtenabout Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; thoughsome, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, ‘Let us have moreQuixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matterwhat it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.’”“And what does the author mean to do?” said Don Quixote.“What?” replied Samson; “why, as soon as he has found the history whichhe is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at oncegive it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to himfrom doing so than by any thought of praise.”Whereat Sancho observed, “The author looks for money and profit, doeshe? It will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry,hurry, with him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in ahurry are never finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let masterMoor, or whatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I andmy master will give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the wayof adventures and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only onesecond part, but a hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we arefast asleep in the straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shodand he will see which foot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that ifmy master would take my advice, we would be now afield, redressingoutrages and righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of goodknights-errant.”Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinantefell upon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happyomen, and he resolved to make another sally in three or four days fromthat time. Announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked hisadvice as to the quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition,and the bachelor replied that in his opinion he ought to go to thekingdom of Aragon, and the city of Saragossa, where there were to becertain solemn joustings at the festival of St. George, at which hemight win renown above all the knights of Aragon, which would bewinning it above all the knights of the world. He commended his verypraiseworthy and gallant resolution, but admonished him to proceed withgreater caution in encountering dangers, because his life did notbelong to him, but to all those who had need of him to protect and aidthem in their misfortunes.“There’s where it is, what I abominate, Señor Samson,” said Sanchohere; “my master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy wouldhalf a dozen melons. Body of the world, señor bachelor! there is a timeto attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be always ‘Santiago,and close Spain!’ Moreover, I have heard it said (and I think by mymaster himself, if I remember rightly) that the mean of valour liesbetween the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if that be so, Idon’t want him to fly without having good reason, or to attack when theodds make it better not. But, above all things, I warn my master thatif he is to take me with him it must be on the condition that he is todo all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to do anythingexcept what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in this I willdance attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw sword, evenagainst rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. I don’t setup to be a fighting man, Señor Samson, but only the best and most loyalsquire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, inconsideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me someisland of the many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts,I will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, Iwas born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence onanyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, andperhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor;and how do I know but that in these governments the devil may haveprepared some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall andknock my grinders out? Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. Butfor all that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island orsomething else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk,I am not such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, ‘when theyoffer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and ‘when good luck comes tothee, take it in.’”“Brother Sancho,” said Carrasco, “you have spoken like a professor;but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Señor Don Quixote, forhe will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.”“It is all the same, be it more or be it less,” replied Sancho; “thoughI can tell Señor Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom hemight give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulseand I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; andI have before now told my master as much.”“Take care, Sancho,” said Samson; “honours change manners, and perhapswhen you find yourself a governor you won’t know the mother that boreyou.”“That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,” saidSancho, “not of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingersdeep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition, isthat likely to show ingratitude to anyone?”“God grant it,” said Don Quixote; “we shall see when the governmentcomes; and I seem to see it already.”He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour ofcomposing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to takeof his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her namewas placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of theverses, “Dulcinea del Toboso” might be read by putting together thefirst letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of thefamous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, hewould not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a greatdifficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name wereseventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, therewould be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they calleddecimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless hewould try to drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name“Dulcinea del Toboso” might be got into four ballad stanzas.“It must be, by some means or other,” said Don Quixote, “for unless thename stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verseswere made for her.”They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place inthree days from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep ita secret, especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from hisniece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution ofhis praiseworthy and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and thentook his leave, charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evilfortunes whenever he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each otherfarewell, and Sancho went away to make the necessary preparations fortheir expedition.p04e.jpg (55K)CHAPTER V.OF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZAAND HIS WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULYRECORDEDp05a.jpg (129K)Full SizeThe translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifthchapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it SanchoPanza speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected fromhis limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does notthink it possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous ofdoing what his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave ituntranslated, and therefore he went on to say:Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed hishappiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, “Whathave you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?”To which he replied, “Wife, if it were God’s will, I should be veryglad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.”“I don’t understand you, husband,” said she, “and I don’t know what youmean by saying you would be glad, if it were God’s will, not to be wellpleased; for, fool as I am, I don’t know how one can find pleasure innot having it.”“Hark ye, Teresa,” replied Sancho, “I am glad because I have made up mymind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means togo out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with himagain, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope thatcheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns likethose we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee andthe children; and if God would be pleased to let me have my dailybread, dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways andcross-roads—and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it—it isclear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness Ihave is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right insaying I would be glad, if it were God’s will, not to be well pleased.”“Look here, Sancho,” said Teresa; “ever since you joined on to aknight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is nounderstanding you.”“It is enough that God understands me, wife,” replied Sancho; “for heis the understander of all things; that will do; but mind, sister, youmust look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that he maybe fit to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle andother harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go roundthe world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons andmonsters, and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings;and even all this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon withYanguesans and enchanted Moors.”“I know well enough, husband,” said Teresa, “that squires-errant don’teat their bread for nothing, and so I will be always praying to ourLord to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune.”“I can tell you, wife,” said Sancho, “if I did not expect to see myselfgovernor of an island before long, I would drop down dead on the spot.”“Nay, then, husband,” said Teresa; “let the hen live, though it be withher pip, live, and let the devil take all the governments in the world;you came out of your mother’s womb without a government, you have liveduntil now without a government, and when it is God’s will you will go,or be carried, to your grave without a government. How many there arein the world who live without a government, and continue to live allthe same, and are reckoned in the number of the people. The best saucein the world is hunger, and as the poor are never without that, theyalways eat with a relish. But mind, Sancho, if by good luck you shouldfind yourself with some government, don’t forget me and your children.Remember that Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it is right he shouldgo to school, if his uncle the abbot has a mind to have him trained forthe Church. Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha will not dieof grief if we marry her; for I have my suspicions that she is as eagerto get a husband as you to get a government; and, after all, a daughterlooks better ill married than well whored.”“By my faith,” replied Sancho, “if God brings me to get any sort of agovernment, I intend, wife, to make such a high match for Mari-Sanchathat there will be no approaching her without calling her ‘my lady.”“Nay, Sancho,” returned Teresa; “marry her to her equal, that is thesafest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs into high-heeledshoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns, outof the plain ‘Marica’ and ‘thou,’ into ‘Doña So-and-so’ and ‘my lady,’the girl won’t know where she is, and at every turn she will fall intoa thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespunstuff.”“Tut, you fool,” said Sancho; “it will be only to practise it for twoor three years; and then dignity and decorum will fit her as easily asa glove; and if not, what matter? Let her be ‘my lady,’ and never mindwhat happens.”“Keep to your own station, Sancho,” replied Teresa; “don’t try to raiseyourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says, ‘wipe the noseof your neigbbour’s son, and take him into your house.’ A fine thing itwould be, indeed, to marry our Maria to some great count or grandgentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuse her and call herclown-bred and clodhopper’s daughter and spinning wench. I have notbeen bringing up my daughter for that all this time, I can tell you,husband. Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying her to mycare; there is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho’s son, a stout, sturdy youngfellow that we know, and I can see he does not look sour at the girl;and with him, one of our own sort, she will be well married, and weshall have her always under our eyes, and be all one family, parentsand children, grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessingof God will dwell among us; so don’t you go marrying her in thosecourts and grand palaces where they won’t know what to make of her, orshe what to make of herself.”“Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,” said Sancho, “what do you meanby trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying mydaughter to one who will give me grandchildren that will be called‘your lordship’? Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard my elders saythat he who does not know how to take advantage of luck when it comesto him, has no right to complain if it gives him the go-by; and nowthat it is knocking at our door, it will not do to shut it out; let usgo with the favouring breeze that blows upon us.”It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made thetranslator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.“Don’t you see, you animal,” continued Sancho, “that it will be wellfor me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out ofthe mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself willfind yourself called ‘Doña Teresa Panza,’ and sitting in church on afine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of allthe born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neithergreater nor less, like a tapestry figure—Let us say no more about it,for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.”“Are you sure of all you say, husband?” replied Teresa. “Well, for allthat, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be herruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but Ican tell you it will not be with my will and consent. I was always alover of equality, brother, and I can’t bear to see people givethemselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism,a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Donsor Doñas; Cascajo was my father’s name, and as I am your wife, I amcalled Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to be called TeresaCascajo; but ‘kings go where laws like,’ and I am content with thisname without having the ‘Don’ put on top of it to make it so heavy thatI cannot carry it; and I don’t want to make people talk about me whenthey see me go dressed like a countess or governor’s wife; for theywill say at once, ‘See what airs the slut gives herself! Only yesterdayshe was always spinning flax, and used to go to mass with the tail ofher petticoat over her head instead of a mantle, and there she goesto-day in a hooped gown with her broaches and airs, as if we didn’tknow her!’ If God keeps me in my seven senses, or five, or whatevernumber I have, I am not going to bring myself to such a pass; go you,brother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger as much asyou like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter nor I aregoing to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman should havea broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at something is avirtuous damsel’s holiday; be off to your adventures along with yourDon Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend themfor us according as we deserve it. I don’t know, I’m sure, who fixedthe ‘Don’ to him, what neither his father nor grandfather ever had.”“I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!” said Sancho.“God help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung together, oneafter the other, without head or tail! What have Cascajo, and thebroaches and the proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say? Lookhere, fool and dolt (for so I may call you, when you don’t understandmy words, and run away from good fortune), if I had said that mydaughter was to throw herself down from a tower, or go roaming theworld, as the Infanta Doña Urraca wanted to do, you would be right innot giving way to my will; but if in an instant, in less than thetwinkling of an eye, I put the ‘Don’ and ‘my lady’ on her back, andtake her out of the stubble, and place her under a canopy, on a dais,and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the Almohades ofMorocco ever had in their family, why won’t you consent and fall inwith my wishes?”“Do you know why, husband?” replied Teresa; “because of the proverbthat says ‘who covers thee, discovers thee.’ At the poor man peopleonly throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and ifthe said rich man was once on a time poor, it is then there is thesneering and the tattle and spite of backbiters; and in the streetshere they swarm as thick as bees.”“Look here, Teresa,” said Sancho, “and listen to what I am now going tosay to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and I do notgive my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions of hisreverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and whosaid, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyesbehold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves onour memory much better and more forcibly than things past.”These observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones onaccount of which the translator says he regards this chapter asapocryphal, inasmuch as they are beyond Sancho’s capacity.“Whence it arises,” he continued, “that when we see any person welldressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants,it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memorymay at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which wehave seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or lowbirth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the onlything that has any existence is what we see before us; and if thisperson whom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (thesewere the very words the padre used) to his present height ofprosperity, be well bred, generous, courteous to all, without seekingto vie with those whose nobility is of ancient date, depend upon it,Teresa, no one will remember what he was, and everyone will respectwhat he is, except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune issafe.”“I do not understand you, husband,” replied Teresa; “do as you like,and don’t break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and ifyou have revolved to do what you say—”“Resolved, you should say, woman,” said Sancho, “not revolved.”“Don’t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,” said Teresa; “I speakas God pleases, and don’t deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say ifyou are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you,and teach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sonsought to inherit and learn the trades of their fathers.”“As soon as I have the government,” said Sancho, “I will send for himby post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, forthere is never any want of people to lend it to governors when theyhave not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is andmake him look what he is to be.”“You send the money,” said Teresa, “and I’ll dress him up for you asfine as you please.”“Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,” saidSancho.“The day that I see her a countess,” replied Teresa, “it will be thesame to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as youplease, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to ourhusbands, though they be dogs;” and with this she began to weep inearnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried.Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess,he would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation cameto an end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and makearrangements for their departure.p05e.jpg (49K)Full SizeCHAPTER VI.OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER;ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORYp06a.jpg (93K)Full SizeWhile Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the aboveirrelevant conversation, Don Quixote’s niece and housekeeper were notidle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncleand master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once morebetake himself to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove byall the means in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme;but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron.Nevertheless, among many other representations made to him, thehousekeeper said to him, “In truth, master, if you do not keep stilland stay quiet at home, and give over roaming mountains and valleyslike a troubled spirit, looking for what they say are calledadventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shall have to make complaintto God and the king with loud supplication to send some remedy.”To which Don Quixote replied, “What answer God will give to yourcomplaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answereither; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer thenumberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of thegreatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listento all and answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairsof mine should worry him.”Whereupon the housekeeper said, “Tell us, señor, at his Majesty’s courtare there no knights?”“There are,” replied Don Quixote, “and plenty of them; and it is rightthere should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for thegreater glory of the king’s majesty.”“Then might not your worship,” said she, “be one of those that, withoutstirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court?”“Recollect, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “all knights cannot becourtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.There must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all knights,there is a great difference between one and another; for the courtiers,without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court, rangethe world over by looking at a map, without its costing them afarthing, and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we,the true knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet,exposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies ofheaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only knowenemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes; and at all risks andon all occasions we attack them, without any regard to childish pointsor rules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lanceor sword, whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance abouthim, whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, andother niceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man toman, that you know nothing about, but I do. And you must know besides,that the true knight-errant, though he may see ten giants, that notonly touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go,each of them, on two tall towers by way of legs, and whose arms arelike the masts of mighty ships, and each eye like a great mill-wheel,and glowing brighter than a glass furnace, must not on any account bedismayed by them. On the contrary, he must attack and fall upon themwith a gallant bearing and a fearless heart, and, if possible, vanquishand destroy them, even though they have for armour the shells of acertain fish, that they say are harder than diamonds, and in place ofswords wield trenchant blades of Damascus steel, or clubs studded withspikes also of steel, such as I have more than once seen. All this Isay, housekeeper, that you may see the difference there is between theone sort of knight and the other; and it would be well if there were noprince who did not set a higher value on this second, or more properlyspeaking first, kind of knights-errant; for, as we read in theirhistories, there have been some among them who have been the salvation,not merely of one kingdom, but of many.”“Ah, señor,” here exclaimed the niece, “remember that all this you aresaying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and their histories,if indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of them, to have asambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be known asinfamous and a corrupter of good manners.”“By the God that gives me life,” said Don Quixote, “if thou wert not myfull niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would inflict achastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all theworld should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy that hardlyknows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue andcriticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Señor Amadis sayif he heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee,for he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, andmoreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that mighthave heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case;for they are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditionedscoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that isso in all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look likegentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are menof low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen,and high gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men oflow rank; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by theirvirtues, the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or bytheir vices; and one has need of experience and discernment todistinguish these two kinds of gentlemen, so much alike in name and sodifferent in conduct.”“God bless me!” said the niece, “that you should know so much,uncle—enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go preach in thestreets—and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and afolly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you areold, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is crookedwhen you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero when youare not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are nothing ofthe kind!”“There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,” returned DonQuixote, “and I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonishyou; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I refrain. Look you,my dears, all the lineages in the world (attend to what I am saying)can be reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had humblebeginnings, and went on spreading and extending themselves until theyattained surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings andmaintained them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of theirorigin; those, again, that from a great beginning have ended in a pointlike a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatnesstill it has come to nought, like the point of a pyramid, which,relatively to its base or foundation, is nothing; and then there arethose—and it is they that are the most numerous—that have had neitheran illustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course, and so will havean end without a name, like an ordinary plebeian line. Of the first,those that had an humble origin and rose to the greatness they stillpreserve, the Ottoman house may serve as an example, which from anhumble and lowly shepherd, its founder, has reached the height at whichwe now see it. For examples of the second sort of lineage, that beganwith greatness and maintains it still without adding to it, there arethe many princes who have inherited the dignity, and maintainthemselves in their inheritance, without increasing or diminishing it,keeping peacefully within the limits of their states. Of those thatbegan great and ended in a point, there are thousands of examples, forall the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the Cæsars of Rome, and thewhole herd (if I may apply such a word to them) of countless princes,monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and barbarians,all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and come tonothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would beimpossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should wefind one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeianlineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swellthe number of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them toany fame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have yougather, my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages,and that only those are seen to be great and illustrious that showthemselves so by the virtue, wealth, and generosity of theirpossessors. I have said virtue, wealth, and generosity, because a greatman who is vicious will be a great example of vice, and a rich man whois not generous will be merely a miserly beggar; for the possessor ofwealth is not made happy by possessing it, but by spending it, and notby spending as he pleases, but by knowing how to spend it well. Thepoor gentleman has no way of showing that he is a gentleman but byvirtue, by being affable, well-bred, courteous, gentle-mannered, andkindly, not haughty, arrogant, or censorious, but above all by beingcharitable; for by two maravedis given with a cheerful heart to thepoor, he will show himself as generous as he who distributes alms withbell-ringing, and no one that perceives him to be endowed with thevirtues I have named, even though he know him not, will fail torecognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it would bestrange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, andthose who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation. There aretwo roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours; oneis that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of arms than ofletters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to arms, wasborn under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore, in ameasure constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel inspite of all the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urgeme to resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and,above all, my own inclination favours; for knowing as I do thecountless toils that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know,too, the infinite blessings that are attained by it; I know that thepath of virtue is very narrow, and the road of vice broad and spacious;I know their ends and goals are different, for the broad and easy roadof vice ends in death, and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue inlife, and not transitory life, but in that which has no end; I know, asour great Castilian poet says, that-It is by rugged paths like these they goThat scale the heights of immortality,Unreached by those that falter here below.”“Woe is me!” exclaimed the niece, “my lord is a poet, too! He knowseverything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if he chose to turnmason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.”“I can tell you, niece,” replied Don Quixote, “if these chivalrousthoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that Icould not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from myhands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.”At this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they askedwho was there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant thehousekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to seehim; in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and hismaster Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and thepair shut themselves up in his room, where they had anotherconversation not inferior to the previous one.p06e.jpg (19K)CHAPTER VII.OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHERVERY NOTABLE INCIDENTSp07a.jpg (140K)Full SizeThe instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with hermaster, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that theresult of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a thirdsally, she seized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran tofind the bachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being awell-spoken man, and a new friend of her master’s, he might be able topersuade him to give up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing thepatio of his house, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feetthe moment she saw him.Carrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her,“What is this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? Onewould think you heart-broken.”“Nothing, Señor Samson,” said she, “only that my master is breakingout, plainly breaking out.”“Whereabouts is he breaking out, señora?” asked Samson; “has any partof his body burst?”“He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,” she replied; “Imean, dear señor bachelor, that he is going to break out again (andthis will be the third time) to hunt all over the world for what hecalls ventures, though I can’t make out why he gives them that name.The first time he was brought back to us slung across the back of anass, and belaboured all over; and the second time he came in anox-cart, shut up in a cage, in which he persuaded himself he wasenchanted, and the poor creature was in such a state that the motherthat bore him would not have known him; lean, yellow, with his eyessunk deep in the cells of his skull; so that to bring him round again,ever so little, cost me more than six hundred eggs, as God knows, andall the world, and my hens too, that won’t let me tell a lie.”“That I can well believe,” replied the bachelor, “for they are so goodand so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing foranother, though they were to burst for it. In short then, mistresshousekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except whatit is feared Don Quixote may do?”“No, señor,” said she.“Well then,” returned the bachelor, “don’t be uneasy, but go home inpeace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are onthe way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is if you know it; forI will come presently and you will see miracles.”“Woe is me,” cried the housekeeper, “is it the prayer of SantaApollonia you would have me say? That would do if it was the toothachemy master had; but it is in the brains, what he has got.”“I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don’t setyourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca,and one can’t be more of a bachelor than that,” replied Carrasco; andwith this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look forthe curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place.While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had adiscussion which the history records with great precision andscrupulous exactness. Sancho said to his master, “Señor, I have educedmy wife to let me go with your worship wherever you choose to take me.”“Induced, you should say, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not educed.”“Once or twice, as well as I remember,” replied Sancho, “I have beggedof your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what Imean by them; and if you don’t understand them to say ‘Sancho,’ or‘devil,’ ‘I don’t understand thee; and if I don’t make my meaningplain, then you may correct me, for I am so focile—”“I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at once; “for Iknow not what ‘I am so focile’ means.”“‘So focile’ means I am so much that way,” replied Sancho.“I understand thee still less now,” said Don Quixote.“Well, if you can’t understand me,” said Sancho, “I don’t know how toput it; I know no more, God help me.”“Oh, now I have hit it,” said Don Quixote; “thou wouldst say thou artso docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say tothee, and submit to what I teach thee.”“I would bet,” said Sancho, “that from the very first you understoodme, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you mighthear me make another couple of dozen blunders.”“May be so,” replied Don Quixote; “but to come to the point, what doesTeresa say?”“Teresa says,” replied Sancho, “that I should make sure with yourworship, and ‘let papers speak and beards be still,’ for ‘he who bindsdoes not wrangle,’ since one ‘take’ is better than two ‘I’ll givethee’s;’ and I say a woman’s advice is no great thing, and he who won’ttake it is a fool.”“And so say I,” said Don Quixote; “continue, Sancho my friend; go on;you talk pearls to-day.”“The fact is,” continued Sancho, “that, as your worship knows betterthan I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, andto-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, andnobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than Godmay be pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes toknock at our life’s door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, norstruggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talkand report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.”“All that is very true,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot make out whatthou art driving at.”“What I am driving at,” said Sancho, “is that your worship settle somefixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, andthat the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don’t care to standon rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help mewith my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be itmuch or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles makea much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To besure, if it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that yourworship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not soungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have therevenue of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in duepromotion.”“Sancho, my friend,” replied Don Quixote, “sometimes proportion may beas good as promotion.”“I see,” said Sancho; “I’ll bet I ought to have said proportion, andnot promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.”“And so well understood,” returned Don Quixote, “that I have seen intothe depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at withthe countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I wouldreadily fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the historiesof the knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, whattheir squires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or thebest part of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of anyknight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire; I only knowthat they all served on reward, and that when they least expected it,if good luck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensedwith an island or something equivalent to it, or at the least they wereleft with a title and lordship. If with these hopes and additionalinducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well and good;but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usageof knight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back toyour house and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likesand you like to be on reward with me, _bene quidem;_ if not, we remainfriends; for if the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lackpigeons; and bear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than abad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation. Ispeak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbsjust as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say,that if you don’t like to come on reward with me, and run the samechance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I shallfind plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not sothickheaded or talkative as you are.”When Sancho heard his master’s firm, resolute language, a cloud cameover the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he hadmade sure that his master would not go without him for all the wealthof the world; and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, SamsonCarrasco came in with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious tohear by what arguments he was about to dissuade their master from goingto seek adventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing himas he had done before, said with a loud voice, “O flower ofknight-errantry! O shining light of arms! O honour and mirror of theSpanish nation! may God Almighty in his infinite power grant that anyperson or persons, who would impede or hinder thy third sally, may findno way out of the labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish whatthey most desire!” And then, turning to the housekeeper, he said,“Mistress housekeeper may just as well give over saying the prayer ofSanta Apollonia, for I know it is the positive determination of thespheres that Señor Don Quixote shall proceed to put into execution hisnew and lofty designs; and I should lay a heavy burden on my consciencedid I not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of hisstrong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit any longer curbed andchecked, for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of theredress of wrongs, of the protection of orphans, of the honour ofvirgins, of the aid of widows, and of the support of wives, and othermatters of this kind appertaining, belonging, proper and peculiar tothe order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord Don Quixote, beautifuland brave, let your worship and highness set out to-day rather thanto-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose,here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were itrequisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it thehappiest good fortune.”At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, “Did I not tell thee,Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now whooffers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor SamsonCarrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancanschools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger orthirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant’ssquire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I shouldshake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, andcut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this newSamson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bringhonour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; forI will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho doesnot deign to accompany me.”“I do deign,” said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; “itshall not be said of me, master mine,” he continued, “‘the bread eatenand the company dispersed.’ Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for allthe world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whomI am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, bymany good words and deeds, your worship’s desire to show me favour; andif I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only toplease my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammerdrives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but,after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a mananyhow, which I can’t deny, I will be one in my own house too, let whowill take it amiss; and so there’s nothing more to do but for yourworship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can’tbe provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Señor Samson’s soulfrom suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade yourworship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again toserve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than allthe squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.”The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho’sphraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part ofhis master’s history he never thought that he could be so droll as hewas there described; but now, hearing him talk of a “will and codicilthat could not be provoked,” instead of “will and codicil that couldnot be revoked,” he believed all he had read of him, and set him downas one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said tohimself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had neverseen. In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and madefriends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco,who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure shouldtake place three days thence, by which time they could have all thatwas requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, whichDon Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one, ashe knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, thoughit was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean likeburnished steel.The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelorwere past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, andin the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, theyraised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, asif it had been his death. Samson’s intention in persuading him to sallyforth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all bythe advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previouslydiscussed the subject. Finally, then, during those three days, DonQuixote and Sancho provided themselves with what they considerednecessary, and Sancho having pacified his wife, and Don Quixote hisniece and housekeeper, at nightfall, unseen by anyone except thebachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of thevillage, they set out for El Toboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinanteand Sancho on his old Dapple, his alforjas furnished with certainmatters in the way of victuals, and his purse with money that DonQuixote gave him to meet emergencies. Samson embraced him, andentreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes, so that hemight rejoice over the former or condole with him over the latter, asthe laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promised him he would doso, and Samson returned to the village, and the other two took the roadfor the great city of El Toboso.p07e.jpg (24K)CHAPTER VIII.WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS LADYDULCINEA DEL TOBOSOp08a.jpg (65K)Full Size“Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!” says Hamete Benengeli on beginningthis eighth chapter; “blessed be Allah!” he repeats three times; and hesays he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he has now got DonQuixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of hisdelightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours of DonQuixote and his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them toforget the former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fixtheir eyes on those that are to come, which now begin on the road to ElToboso, as the others began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it muchthat he asks in consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on tosay:Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took hisdeparture, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by bothknight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple werelouder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred thathis good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master,building, perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known,though the history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, thatwhen he stumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not comeout, for by stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but adamaged shoe or a broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not muchastray in this.Said Don Quixote, “Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as wego, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, andthere I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of thepeerless Dulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured thatI shall conclude and bring to a happy termination every perilousadventure; for nothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous thanfinding themselves favoured by their ladies.”p08b.jpg (283K)Full Size“So I believe,” replied Sancho; “but I think it will be difficult foryour worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where you willbe able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it over thewall of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took her theletter that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doingin the heart of Sierra Morena.”“Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“where or at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled graceand beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or portico of somerich and royal palace.”“It might have been all that,” returned Sancho, “but to me it lookedlike a wall, unless I am short of memory.”“At all events, let us go there, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for, sothat I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or at awindow, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden; forany beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give lightto my reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be unmatched andunequalled in wisdom and valour.”“Well, to tell the truth, señor,” said Sancho, “when I saw that sun ofthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to throw outbeams at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting thatwheat I told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her facelike a cloud and dimmed it.”“What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “in saying,thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was siftingwheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with whatis and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who areconstituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that showtheir rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines ofour poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, thosefour nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus andseated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues whichthe ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked andwoven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort musthave been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that thespite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything ofmine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns theminto shapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of myachievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author wassome sage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing foranother, mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himselfby relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence ofa true history. O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm ofthe virtues! All the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure withthem; but envy brings nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.”“So I say too,” replied Sancho; “and I suspect in that legend orhistory of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw, myhonour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweepingthe streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, Inever spoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am tobe envied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice ofthe rogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of mysimplicity, always natural and never acted; and if I had no other meritsave that I believe, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and allthe holy Roman Catholic Church holds and believes, and that I am amortal enemy of the Jews, the historians ought to have mercy on me andtreat me well in their writings. But let them say what they like; nakedwas I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain; nay, while Isee myself put into a book and passed on from hand to hand over theworld, I don’t care a fig, let them say what they like of me.”“That, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “reminds me of what happened to afamous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire againstall the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a certain ladyof whom it was questionable whether she was one or not. She, seeing shewas not in the list of the poet, asked him what he had seen in her thathe did not include her in the number of the others, telling him he mustadd to his satire and put her in the new part, or else look out for theconsequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her without ashred of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame though itwas infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherdwho set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the sevenwonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of making hisname live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, ormention his name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of hisambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he wascalled Erostratus. And something of the same sort is what happened inthe case of the great emperor Charles V. and a gentleman in Rome. Theemperor was anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called inancient times the temple ‘of all the gods,’ but now-a-days, by a betternomenclature, ‘of all the saints,’ which is the best preserved buildingof all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the one which bestsustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of itsfounders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions,and well lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which isadmitted by a window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it wasfrom this that the emperor examined the building. A Roman gentlemanstood by his side and explained to him the skilful construction andingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful architecture, and whenthey had left the skylight he said to the emperor, ‘A thousand times,your Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon me to seize your Majesty inmy arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight, so as to leavebehind me in the world a name that would last for ever.’ ‘I am thankfulto you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect,’ said theemperor, ‘and I shall give you no opportunity in future of againputting your loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever tospeak to me or to be where I am; and he followed up these words bybestowing a liberal bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that thedesire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive. What, thinkestthou, was it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridgeinto the depths of the Tiber? What burned the hand and arm of Mutius?What impelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that openedin the midst of Rome? What, in opposition to all the omens thatdeclared against him, made Julius Cæsar cross the Rubicon? And to cometo more modern examples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded andcut off the gallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteousCortés in the New World? All these and a variety of other greatexploits are, were and will be, the work of fame that mortals desire asa reward and a portion of the immortality their famous deeds deserve;though we Catholic Christians and knights-errant look more to thatfuture glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven thanto the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in this presenttransitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must after allend with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, OSancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which theChristian religion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay pridein giants, envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmnessof demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of ourdiet and the length of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty wepreserve to those whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts,indolence by traversing the world in all directions seekingopportunities of making ourselves, besides Christians, famous knights.Such, Sancho, are the means by which we reach those extremes of praisethat fair fame carries with it.”“All that your worship has said so far,” said Sancho, “I haveunderstood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worship woulddissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind.”“Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “say on, in God’sname, and I will answer as well as I can.”“Tell me, señor,” Sancho went on to say, “those Julys or Augusts, andall those venturous knights that you say are now dead—where are theynow?”“The heathens,” replied Don Quixote, “are, no doubt, in hell; theChristians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or inheaven.”“Very good,” said Sancho; “but now I want to know—the tombs where thebodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before them, orare the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are theyornamented with?”To which Don Quixote made answer: “The tombs of the heathens weregenerally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Cæsar’s body wereplaced on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now callin Rome Saint Peter’s needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb acastle as large as a good-sized village, which they called the _MolesAdriani_, and is now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queenArtemisia buried her husband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned oneof the seven wonders of the world; but none of these tombs, or of themany others of the heathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or anyof those other offerings and tokens that show that they who are buriedthere are saints.”“That’s the point I’m coming to,” said Sancho; “and now tell me, whichis the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?”“The answer is easy,” replied Don Quixote; “it is a greater work tobring to life a dead man.”“Now I have got you,” said Sancho; “in that case the fame of them whobring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples,restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lampsburning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their kneesadoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the otherthan that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that haveever been in the world have left or may leave behind them?”“That I grant, too,” said Don Quixote.“Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you callit,” said Sancho, “belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who,with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church, havelamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, bymeans of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christianreputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on theirshoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn theiroratories and favourite altars with them.”“What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?”asked Don Quixote.“My meaning is,” said Sancho, “let us set about becoming saints, and weshall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for youknow, señor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it is so latelyone may say so) they canonised and beatified two little barefootfriars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touchthe iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, andthey are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword ofRoland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that,señor, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter whatorder, than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen ofpenance lashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, bethey given to giants, or monsters, or dragons.”“All that is true,” returned Don Quixote, “but we cannot all be friars,and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven; chivalry isa religion, there are sainted knights in glory.”“Yes,” said Sancho, “but I have heard say that there are more friars inheaven than knights-errant.”“That,” said Don Quixote, “is because those in religious orders aremore numerous than knights.”“The errants are many,” said Sancho.“Many,” replied Don Quixote, “but few they who deserve the name ofknights.”With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed thatnight and the following day, without anything worth mention happeningto them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at lengththe next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso,at the sight of which Don Quixote’s spirits rose and Sancho’s fell, forhe did not know Dulcinea’s house, nor in all his life had he ever seenher, any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the oneto see her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a lossto know what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In theend, Don Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, andthey waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near ElToboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they madetheir entrance into the city, where something happened them that mayfairly be called something.p08e.jpg (49K)Full SizeCHAPTER IX.WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT WILL BE SEEN THEREp09a.jpg (79K)Full Size’Twas at the very midnight hour—more or less—when Don Quixote andSancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deepsilence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on thebroad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, thoughSancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find inthe darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothingwas to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears ofDon Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an assbrayed, pigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they madeseemed louder in the silence of the night; all which the enamouredknight took to be of evil omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho,“Sancho, my son, lead on to the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that weshall find her awake.”“Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,” said Sancho, “when whatI saw her highness in was only a very little house?”“Most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of herpalace,” said Don Quixote, “to amuse herself with damsels, as greatladies and princesses are accustomed to do.”“Señor,” said Sancho, “if your worship will have it in spite of me thatthe house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you,to find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking tillthey hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion allthrough the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of ourwenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour,however late it may be?”“Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,” replied DonQuixote, “and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; butlook, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one seesfrom here should be Dulcinea’s palace.”“Then let your worship lead the way,” said Sancho, “perhaps it may beso; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I’llbelieve it as much as I believe it is daylight now.”Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundredpaces he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was agreat tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was nopalace, but the chief church of the town, and said he, “It’s the churchwe have lit upon, Sancho.”“So I see,” said Sancho, “and God grant we may not light upon ourgraves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard atthis time of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don’tmistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley without anoutlet.”“The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!” said Don Quixote; “wherehast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleyswithout an outlet?”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “every country has a way of its own; perhapshere in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings inalleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among thesestreets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, Imay stumble on this palace—and I wish I saw the dogs eating it forleading us such a dance.”“Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,” said DonQuixote; “let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope afterthe bucket.”“I’ll hold my tongue,” said Sancho, “but how am I to take it patientlywhen your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of ourmistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, whenyour worship can’t find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?”“Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “Lookhere, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that I have neveronce in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed the threshold ofher palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the greatreputation she bears for beauty and discretion?”“I hear it now,” returned Sancho; “and I may tell you that if you havenot seen her, no more have I.”“That cannot be,” said Don Quixote, “for, at any rate, thou saidst, onbringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee, that thou sawesther sifting wheat.”“Don’t mind that, señor,” said Sancho; “I must tell you that my seeingher and the answer I brought you back were by hearsay too, for I can nomore tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I can hit the sky.”“Sancho, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there are times for jests andtimes when jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I have neitherseen nor spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thoushouldst say thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contraryis the case, as thou well knowest.”While the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived someonewith a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and fromthe noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessedhim to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to hiswork, and so it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad thatsays-Ill did ye fare, ye men of France,In Roncesvalles chase—“May I die, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, when he heard him, “if any goodwill come to us to-night! Dost thou not hear what that clown issinging?”“I do,” said Sancho, “but what has Roncesvalles chase to do with whatwe have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad ofCalainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.”By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, “Canyou tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is thepalace of the peerless princess Doña Dulcinea del Toboso?”“Señor,” replied the lad, “I am a stranger, and I have been only a fewdays in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that houseopposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, andboth or either of them will be able to give your worship some accountof this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of ElToboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in thewhole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own houseeach of them may be a princess.”“Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,”said Don Quixote.“May be so,” replied the lad; “God be with you, for here comes thedaylight;” and without waiting for any more of his questions, hewhipped on his mules.Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said tohim, “Señor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do forus to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us toquit the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in theneighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won’t leave anook or corner of the whole village that I won’t search for the house,castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if Idon’t find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to hergrace, and tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her toarrange some plan for you to see her without any damage to her honourand reputation.”“Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast delivered a thousand sentencescondensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee for the advicethou hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son, let us golook for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thousayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion andcourtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.”Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he shoulddiscover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the SierraMorena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, whichthey took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forestor thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returnedto the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell himwhich demand fresh attention and a new chapter.p09e.jpg (34K)CHAPTER X.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE CRAFTY DEVICE SANCHO ADOPTED TO ENCHANT THE LADYDULCINEA, AND OTHER INCIDENTS AS LUDICROUS AS THEY ARE TRUEp10a.jpg (142K)Full SizeWhen the author of this great history comes to relate what is set downin this chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over insilence, fearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote’smadness reaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, andeven goes a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest. But after all,though still under the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded itwithout adding to the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, andentirely disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be broughtagainst him; and he was right, for the truth may run fine but will notbreak, and always rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so,going on with his story, he says that as soon as Don Quixote hadensconced himself in the forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, hebade Sancho return to the city, and not come into his presence againwithout having first spoken on his behalf to his lady, and begged ofher that it might be her good pleasure to permit herself to be seen byher enslaved knight, and deign to bestow her blessing upon him, so thathe might thereby hope for a happy issue in all his encounters anddifficult enterprises. Sancho undertook to execute the task accordingto the instructions, and to bring back an answer as good as the one hebrought back before.“Go, my son,” said Don Quixote, “and be not dazed when thou findestthyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going toseek. Happy thou, above all the squires in the world! Bear in mind, andlet it not escape thy memory, how she receives thee; if she changescolour while thou art giving her my message; if she is agitated anddisturbed at hearing my name; if she cannot rest upon her cushion,shouldst thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamberproper to her rank; and should she be standing, observe if she poisesherself now on one foot, now on the other; if she repeats two or threetimes the reply she gives thee; if she passes from gentleness toausterity, from asperity to tenderness; if she raises her hand tosmooth her hair though it be not disarranged. In short, my son, observeall her actions and motions, for if thou wilt report them to me as theywere, I will gather what she hides in the recesses of her heart asregards my love; for I would have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest itnot, that with lovers the outward actions and motions they give way towhen their loves are in question are the faithful messengers that carrythe news of what is going on in the depths of their hearts. Go, myfriend, may better fortune than mine attend thee, and bring thee ahappier issue than that which I await in dread in this drearysolitude.”“I will go and return quickly,” said Sancho; “cheer up that littleheart of yours, master mine, for at the present moment you seem to havegot one no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that astout heart breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches thereare no pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it’s notlooked for. I say this because, if we could not find my lady’s palacesor castles to-night, now that it is daylight I count upon finding themwhen I least expect it, and once found, leave it to me to manage her.”“Verily, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou dost always bring in thyproverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give me better luck inwhat I am anxious about.”With this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and DonQuixote remained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrupsand leaning on the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubledforebodings; and there we will leave him, and accompany Sancho, whowent off no less serious and troubled than he left his master; so muchso, that as soon as he had got out of the thicket, and looking roundsaw that Don Quixote was not within sight, he dismounted from his ass,and seating himself at the foot of a tree began to commune withhimself, saying, “Now, brother Sancho, let us know where your worshipis going. Are you going to look for some ass that has been lost? Not atall. Then what are you going to look for? I am going to look for aprincess, that’s all; and in her for the sun of beauty and the wholeheaven at once. And where do you expect to find all this, Sancho?Where? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well, and for whom are yougoing to look for her? For the famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,who rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirst and drink to thehungry. That’s all very well, but do you know her house, Sancho? Mymaster says it will be some royal palace or grand castle. And have youever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master ever saw her. Anddoes it strike you that it would be just and right if the El Tobosopeople, finding out that you were here with the intention of going totamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were to come andcudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They would,indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am underorders, and that ‘you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs toyou.’ Don’t you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are ashot-tempered as they are honest, and won’t put up with liberties fromanybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse foryou, I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Whyshould I go looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; andwhat is more, when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica inRavena, or the bachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobodyelse, has mixed me up in this business!”Such was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusionhe could come to was to say to himself again, “Well, there’s remedy foreverything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass, whetherwe like it or not, when life’s finished. I have seen by a thousandsigns that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and for thatmatter, I too, am not behind him; for I’m a greater fool than he iswhen I follow him and serve him, if there’s any truth in the proverbthat says, ‘Tell me what company thou keepest, and I’ll tell thee whatthou art,’ or in that other, ‘Not with whom thou art bred, but withwhom thou art fed.’ Well then, if he be mad, as he is, and with amadness that mostly takes one thing for another, and white for black,and black for white, as was seen when he said the windmills weregiants, and the monks’ mules dromedaries, flocks of sheep armies ofenemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not be very hard tomake him believe that some country girl, the first I come across here,is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does not believe it, I’ll swear it; andif he should swear, I’ll swear again; and if he persists I’ll persiststill more, so as, come what may, to have my quoit always over the peg.Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may put a stop to his sending meon messages of this kind another time; or maybe he will think, as Isuspect he will, that one of those wicked enchanters, who he says havea spite against him, has changed her form for the sake of doing him anill turn and injuring him.”With this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the businessas good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to makeDon Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; andthings turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple,he spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, threepeasant girls on three colts, or fillies—for the author does not makethe point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, theusual mount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence,we need not stop to prove it.To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned fullspeed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousandpassionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, “Whatnews, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or ablack?”“Your worship,” replied Sancho, “had better mark it with ruddle, likethe inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it maysee it plain.”“Then thou bringest good news,” said Don Quixote.“So good,” replied Sancho, “that your worship has only to spurRocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea delToboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see yourworship.”“Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?” exclaimed DonQuixote. “Take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by false joyto cheer my real sadness.”“What could I get by deceiving your worship,” returned Sancho,“especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth ornot? Come, señor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistresscoming, robed and adorned—in fact, like what she is. Her damsels andshe are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, allrubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hairloose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind;and moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finestsight ever you saw.”“Hackneys, you mean, Sancho,” said Don Quixote.“There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,” saidSancho; “but no matter what they come on, there they are, the finestladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess Dulcinea,who staggers one’s senses.”“Let us go, Sancho, my son,” said Don Quixote, “and in guerdon of thisnews, as unexpected as it is good, I bestow upon thee the best spoil Ishall win in the first adventure I may have; or if that does notsatisfy thee, I promise thee the foals I shall have this year from mythree mares that thou knowest are in foal on our village common.”“I’ll take the foals,” said Sancho; “for it is not quite certain thatthe spoils of the first adventure will be good ones.”By this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three villagelasses close at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to ElToboso, and as he could see nobody except the three peasant girls, hewas completely puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city hehad left them.“How outside the city?” returned Sancho. “Are your worship’s eyes inthe back of your head, that you can’t see that they are these who arecoming here, shining like the very sun at noonday?”“I see nothing, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but three country girls onthree jackasses.”“Now, may God deliver me from the devil!” said Sancho, “and can it bethat your worship takes three hackneys—or whatever they’re called—aswhite as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, I could tear mybeard if that was the case!”“Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “that itis as plain they are jackasses—or jennyasses—as that I am Don Quixote,and thou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so.”“Hush, señor,” said Sancho, “don’t talk that way, but open your eyes,and come and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who isclose upon us now;” and with these words he advanced to receive thethree village lasses, and dismounting from Dapple, caught hold of oneof the asses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping onboth knees on the ground, he said, “Queen and princess and duchess ofbeauty, may it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive intoyour favour and good-will your captive knight who stands there turnedinto marble stone, and quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himselfin your magnificent presence. I am Sancho Panza, his squire, and he thevagabond knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called ‘The Knightof the Rueful Countenance.’”Don Quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside Sancho,and, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, wasregarding her whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he could seenothing in her except a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one,for she was platter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed andbewildered, and did not venture to open his lips. The country girls, atthe same time, were astonished to see these two men, so different inappearance, on their knees, preventing their companion from going on.She, however, who had been stopped, breaking silence, said angrily andtestily, “Get out of the way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for weare in a hurry.”p10b.jpg (319K)Full SizeTo which Sancho returned, “Oh, princess and universal lady of ElToboso, is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar andprop of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?”On hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, “Woa then! why, I’mrubbing thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlingscome to make game of the village girls now, as if we here could notchaff as well as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, andit will be better for you.”“Get up, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this; “I see that fortune, ‘withevil done to me unsated still,’ has taken possession of all the roadsby which any comfort may reach ‘this wretched soul’ that I carry in myflesh. And thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired,utmost limit of grace in human shape, sole relief of this afflictedheart that adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes mehas brought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and themonly, transformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features intothose of a poor peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same timechanged mine into those of some monster to render them loathsome in thysight, refuse not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing inthis submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty thehumility with which my soul adores thee.”“Hey-day! My grandfather!” cried the girl, “much I care for yourlove-making! Get out of the way and let us pass, and we’ll thank you.”Sancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got sowell out of the hobble he was in. The instant the village lass who haddone duty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her “cackney” witha spike she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed acrossthe field. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely thanusual, began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea tothe ground; seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sanchoto fix and girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under theass’s belly. The pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about tolift up his enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast,the lady, getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, goingback a little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on thecroup of the ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than afalcon, and sat astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, “Rogue! butour lady is lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverestCordovan or Mexican how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle inone jump, and without spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra;and her damsels are no way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;”which was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, theypushed on after her, and sped away without looking back, for more thanhalf a league.Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longerin sight, he turned to Sancho and said, “How now, Sancho? thou seesthow I am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice andspite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness itwould give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I wasborn to be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at whichthe arrows of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho,that these traitors were not content with changing and transforming myDulcinea, but they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean andill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and at the same timethey robbed her of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies ofdistinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of beingalways among perfumes and flowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, thatwhen I approached to put Dulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest itwas, though to me it appeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of rawgarlic that made my head reel, and poisoned my very heart.”“O scum of the earth!” cried Sancho at this, “O miserable, spitefulenchanters! O that I could see you all strung by the gills, likesardines on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great deal, andye do a great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you, yescoundrels, to have changed the pearls of my lady’s eyes into oakgalls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox’stail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, withoutmeddling with her smell; for by that we might somehow have found outwhat was hidden underneath that ugly rind; though, to tell the truth, Inever perceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised tothe highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip,like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold,and more than a palm long.”“From the correspondence which exists between those of the face andthose of the body,” said Don Quixote, “Dulcinea must have another moleresembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she hasthe one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned arevery long for moles.”“Well, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,” repliedSancho.“I believe it, my friend,” returned Don Quixote; “for nature bestowednothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, ifshe had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her theywould not be moles, but moons and shining stars. But tell me, Sancho,that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it, wasit a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?”“It was neither,” replied Sancho, “but a jineta saddle, with a fieldcovering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it.”“And that I could not see all this, Sancho!” said Don Quixote; “oncemore I say, and will say a thousand times, I am the most unfortunate ofmen.”Sancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearingthe simplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. At length,after a good deal more conversation had passed between them, theyremounted their beasts, and followed the road to Saragossa, which theyexpected to reach in time to take part in a certain grand festivalwhich is held every year in that illustrious city; but before they gotthere things happened to them, so many, so important, and so strange,that they deserve to be recorded and read, as will be seen farther on.p10e.jpg (56K)Full SizeCHAPTER XI.OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE CAROR CART OF “THE CORTES OF DEATH”p11a.jpg (172K)Full SizeDejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turningover in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him inchanging his lady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, norcould he think of any way of restoring her to her original form; andthese reflections so absorbed him, that without being aware of it helet go Rocinante’s bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that wasgranted him, stopped at every step to crop the fresh grass with whichthe plain abounded.Sancho recalled him from his reverie. “Melancholy, señor,” said he,“was made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way to itovermuch they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; beyourself again; gather up Rocinante’s reins; cheer up, rouse yourselfand show that gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. Whatthe devil is this? What weakness is this? Are we here or in France? Thedevil fly away with all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-beingof a single knight-errant is of more consequence than all theenchantments and transformations on earth.”“Hush, Sancho,” said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice, “hush andutter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for I alone am toblame for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come of thehatred the wicked bear me.”“So say I,” returned Sancho; “his heart rend in twain, I trow, who sawher once, to see her now.”“Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “as thousawest her in the full perfection of her beauty; for the enchantmentdoes not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness fromthee; against me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venomdirected. Nevertheless, there is one thing which has occurred to me,and that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, as wellas I recollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes thatare like pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, andI am persuaded that Dulcinea’s must be green emeralds, full and soft,with two rainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyesand transfer them to her teeth; for beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hasttaken the one for the other, the eyes for the teeth.”“Very likely,” said Sancho; “for her beauty bewildered me as much asher ugliness did your worship; but let us leave it all to God, whoalone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evil worldof ours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixtureof wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, señor, troublesme more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done whenyour worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders himto go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Whereis this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to findher? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking likenoddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her inthe middle of the street they won’t know her any more than they wouldmy father.”“Perhaps, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “the enchantment does not goso far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of thepower of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one ortwo of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her ornot, by commanding them to return and give me an account of whathappened to them in this respect.”“I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,” saidSancho; “and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know;and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, themisfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the ladyDulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it,and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Timeto take his own course; for he is the best physician for these andgreater ailments.”Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented bya cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strangepersonages and figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules andacted as carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky,without a tilt or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itselfto Don Quixote’s eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; nextto it was an angel with large painted wings, and at one side anemperor, with a crown, to all appearance of gold, on his head. At thefeet of Death was the god called Cupid, without his bandage, but withhis bow, quiver, and arrows; there was also a knight in full armour,except that he had no morion or helmet, but only a hat decked withplumes of divers colours; and along with these there were others with avariety of costumes and faces. All this, unexpectedly encountered, tookDon Quixote somewhat aback, and struck terror into the heart of Sancho;but the next instant Don Quixote was glad of it, believing that somenew perilous adventure was presenting itself to him, and under thisimpression, and with a spirit prepared to face any danger, he plantedhimself in front of the cart, and in a loud and menacing tone,exclaimed, “Carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever thou art, tellme at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who these folk arethou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like Charon’s boat than anordinary cart.”To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, “Señor, we areplayers of Angulo el Malo’s company; we have been acting the play of‘The Cortés of Death’ this morning, which is the octave of CorpusChristi, in a village behind that hill, and we have to act it thisafternoon in that village which you can see from this; and as it is sonear, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again, we goin the costumes in which we perform. That lad there appears as Death,that other as an angel, that woman, the manager’s wife, plays thequeen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and Iam one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company Itake the leading parts. If you want to know anything more about us, askme and I will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil Iam up to everything.”“By the faith of a knight-errant,” replied Don Quixote, “when I sawthis cart I fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me;but I declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, ifillusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keep yourfestival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can renderyou a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child Iwas fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor’s art.”While they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in amummers’ dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blownox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrewapproaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging theground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of thebells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spiteof Don Quixote’s efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between histeeth he set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones ofhis anatomy ever gave any promise of.p11b.jpg (327K)Full SizeSancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumpedoff Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time hereached him he was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante,who had come down with his master, the usual end and upshot ofRocinante’s vivacity and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quittedhis beast to go and help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with thebladders jumped up on Dapple, and beating him with them, more by thefright and the noise than by the pain of the blows, made him fly acrossthe fields towards the village where they were going to hold theirfestival. Sancho witnessed Dapple’s career and his master’s fall, anddid not know which of the two cases of need he should attend to first;but in the end, like a good squire and good servant, he let his lovefor his master prevail over his affection for his ass; though everytime he saw the bladders rise in the air and come down on the hindquarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and terrors of death, and hewould have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his own eyes thanon the least hair of his ass’s tail. In this trouble and perplexity hecame to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than he liked,and having helped him to mount Rocinante, he said to him, “Señor, thedevil has carried off my Dapple.”“What devil?” asked Don Quixote.“The one with the bladders,” said Sancho.“Then I will recover him,” said Don Quixote, “even if he be shut upwith him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow me,Sancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will makegood the loss of Dapple.”“You need not take the trouble, señor,” said Sancho; “keep cool, for asI now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back to his oldquarters;” and so it turned out, for, having come down with Dapple, inimitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot tothe town, and the ass came back to his master.“For all that,” said Don Quixote, “it will be well to visit thediscourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if itwere the emperor himself.”“Don’t think of it, your worship,” returned Sancho; “take my advice andnever meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself haveknown an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;remember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyonefavours and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above allwhen they are those of the royal companies and under patent, all ormost of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.”“Still, for all that,” said Don Quixote, “the player devil must not gooff boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.”So saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,shouting out as he went, “Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want toteach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires ofknights-errant for steeds.”So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heardand understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker’sintention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and theemperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen orthe god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones andformed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of theirpebbles. Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant arraywith uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checkedRocinante and began to consider in what way he could attack them withthe least danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeinghim disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, “Itwould be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember,señor, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there isno defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under abrass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, andnot valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it,and where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to helpthem; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps itwill to know for certain that among all these, though they look likekings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.”“Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “whichmay and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed. Icannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a time before told thee,against anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, Sancho, ifthou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy Dapple; and Iwill help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.”“There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, señor,” repliedSancho; “for it is not the part of good Christians to revenge wrongs;and besides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave his grievance to mygood-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heavengrants me life.”“Well,” said Don Quixote, “if that be thy determination, good Sancho,sensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us leave thesephantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthieradventures; for, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail tofind plenty of marvellous ones in it.”He at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his Dapple,Death and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued theirjourney, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death endedhappily, thanks to the advice Sancho gave his master; who had, thefollowing day, a fresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest thanthe last, with an enamoured knight-errant.p11e.jpg (20K)CHAPTER XII.OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THEBOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORSp12a.jpg (98K)Full SizeThe night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixoteand his squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote atSancho’s persuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, andover their supper Sancho said to his master, “Señor, what a fool Ishould have looked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of thefirst adventure your worship achieved, instead of the foals of thethree mares. After all, ‘a sparrow in the hand is better than a vultureon the wing.’”“At the same time, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “if thou hadst let meattack them as I wanted, at the very least the emperor’s gold crown andCupid’s painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils, for I shouldhave taken them by force and given them into thy hands.”“The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,” said Sancho,“were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “for it would not be right that theaccessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere fictionsand semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho—and, as anecessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it—Iwould that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instrumentsof great good to the State, placing before us at every step a mirror inwhich we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor isthere any similitude that shows us more faithfully what we are andought to be than the play and the players. Come, tell me, hast thou notseen a play acted in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies,and divers other personages were introduced? One plays the villain,another the knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one thesharp-witted fool, another the foolish lover; and when the play isover, and they have put off the dresses they wore in it, all the actorsbecome equal.”“Yes, I have seen that,” said Sancho.“Well then,” said Don Quixote, “the same thing happens in the comedyand life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, inshort, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when itis over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of thegarments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in thegrave.”“A fine comparison!” said Sancho; “though not so new but that I haveheard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game ofchess; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its ownparticular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed,jumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which ismuch like ending life in the grave.”“Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,” saidDon Quixote.“Ay,” said Sancho; “it must be that some of your worship’s shrewdnesssticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come toyield good fruit if you dung it and till it; what I mean is that yourworship’s conversation has been the dung that has fallen on the barrensoil of my dry wit, and the time I have been in your service andsociety has been the tillage; and with the help of this I hope to yieldfruit in abundance that will not fall away or slide from those paths ofgood breeding that your worship has made in my parched understanding.”Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s affected phraseology, and perceivedthat what he said about his improvement was true, for now and then hespoke in a way that surprised him; though always, or mostly, whenSancho tried to talk fine and attempted polite language, he wound up bytoppling over from the summit of his simplicity into the abyss of hisignorance; and where he showed his culture and his memory to thegreatest advantage was in dragging in proverbs, no matter whether theyhad any bearing or not upon the subject in hand, as may have been seenalready and will be noticed in the course of this history.p12b.jpg (298K)Full SizeIn conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, butSancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he usedto say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left himat liberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante’s saddle, ashis master’s express orders were, that so long as they were in thefield or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped—theancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to takeoff the bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddlefrom the horse—never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the sameliberty he had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was afriendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down bytradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious historydevoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve thepropriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he did not inserttherein; although at times he forgets this resolution of his anddescribes how eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another whenthey were together and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinantewould lay his neck across Dapple’s, stretching half a yard or more onthe other side, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully onthe ground, for three days, or at least so long as they were leftalone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for food. I may addthat they say the author left it on record that he likened theirfriendship to that of Nisus and Euryalus, and Pylades and Orestes; andif that be so, it may be perceived, to the admiration of mankind, howfirm the friendship must have been between these two peaceful animals,shaming men, who preserve friendships with one another so badly. Thiswas why it was said-For friend no longer is there friend;The reeds turn lances now.And someone else has sung—Friend to friend the bug, etc.and let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he comparedthe friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have receivedmany lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, forexample, the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog,watchfulness from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from theelephant, and loyalty from the horse.Sancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while DonQuixote dozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only hadelapsed when a noise he heard behind him awoke him, and rising upstartled, he listened and looked in the direction the noise came from,and perceived two men on horseback, one of whom, letting himself dropfrom the saddle, said to the other, “Dismount, my friend, and take thebridles off the horses, for, so far as I can see, this place willfurnish grass for them, and the solitude and silence my love-sickthoughts need of.” As he said this he stretched himself upon theground, and as he flung himself down, the armour in which he was cladrattled, whereby Don Quixote perceived that he must be a knight-errant;and going over to Sancho, who was asleep, he shook him by the arm andwith no small difficulty brought him back to his senses, and said in alow voice to him, “Brother Sancho, we have got an adventure.”“God send us a good one,” said Sancho; “and where may her ladyship theadventure be?”“Where, Sancho?” replied Don Quixote; “turn thine eyes and look, andthou wilt see stretched there a knight-errant, who, it strikes me, isnot over and above happy, for I saw him fling himself off his horse andthrow himself on the ground with a certain air of dejection, and hisarmour rattled as he fell.”“Well,” said Sancho, “how does your worship make out that to be anadventure?”“I do not mean to say,” returned Don Quixote, “that it is a completeadventure, but that it is the beginning of one, for it is in this wayadventures begin. But listen, for it seems he is tuning a lute orguitar, and from the way he is spitting and clearing his chest he mustbe getting ready to sing something.”“Faith, you are right,” said Sancho, “and no doubt he is some enamouredknight.”“There is no knight-errant that is not,” said Don Quixote; “but let uslisten to him, for, if he sings, by that thread we shall extract theball of his thoughts; because out of the abundance of the heart themouth speaketh.”Sancho was about to reply to his master, but the Knight of the Grove’svoice, which was neither very bad nor very good, stopped him, andlistening attentively the pair heard him sing thisSONNETYour pleasure, prithee, lady mine, unfold;Declare the terms that I am to obey;My will to yours submissively I mould,And from your law my feet shall never stray.Would you I die, to silent grief a prey?Then count me even now as dead and cold;Would you I tell my woes in some new way?Then shall my tale by Love itself be told.The unison of opposites to prove,Of the soft wax and diamond hard am I;But still, obedient to the laws of love,Here, hard or soft, I offer you my breast,Whate’er you grave or stamp thereon shall restIndelible for all eternity.With an “Ah me!” that seemed to be drawn from the inmost recesses ofhis heart, the Knight of the Grove brought his lay to an end, andshortly afterwards exclaimed in a melancholy and piteous voice, “Ofairest and most ungrateful woman on earth! What! can it be, mostserene Casildea de Vandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captiveknight to waste away and perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude andarduous toils? It is not enough that I have compelled all the knightsof Navarre, all the Leonese, all the Tartesians, all the Castilians,and finally all the knights of La Mancha, to confess thee the mostbeautiful in the world?”“Not so,” said Don Quixote at this, “for I am of La Mancha, and I havenever confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor should I confessa thing so much to the prejudice of my lady’s beauty; thou seest howthis knight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen, perhaps he will tellus more about himself.”“That he will,” returned Sancho, “for he seems in a mood to bewailhimself for a month at a stretch.”But this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voicesnear him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimedin a distinct but courteous tone, “Who goes there? What are you? Do youbelong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?”“Of the miserable,” answered Don Quixote.“Then come to me,” said he of the Grove, “and rest assured that it isto woe itself and affliction itself you come.”Don Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteousmanner, went over to him, and so did Sancho.The doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, “Sit down here,sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that professknight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you inthis place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and properretreat of knights-errant, keep you company.” To which Don made answer,“A knight I am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows,misfortunes, and calamities have made my heart their abode, thecompassion I feel for the misfortunes of others has not been therebybanished from it. From what you have just now sung I gather that yoursspring from love, I mean from the love you bear that fair ingrate younamed in your lament.”In the meantime, they had seated themselves together on the hard groundpeaceably and sociably, just as if, as soon as day broke, they were notgoing to break one another’s heads.“Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?” asked he of the Grove of DonQuixote.“By mischance I am,” replied Don Quixote; “though the ills arising fromwell-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather thanmisfortunes.”“That is true,” returned he of the Grove, “if scorn did not unsettleour reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks likerevenge.”“I was never scorned by my lady,” said Don Quixote.“Certainly not,” said Sancho, who stood close by, “for my lady is as alamb, and softer than a roll of butter.”“Is this your squire?” asked he of the Grove.“He is,” said Don Quixote.“I never yet saw a squire,” said he of the Grove, “who ventured tospeak when his master was speaking; at least, there is mine, who is asbig as his father, and it cannot be proved that he has ever opened hislips when I am speaking.”“By my faith then,” said Sancho, “I have spoken, and am fit to speak,in the presence of one as much, or even—but never mind—it only makes itworse to stir it.”The squire of the Grove took Sancho by the arm, saying to him, “Let ustwo go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please, andleave these gentlemen our masters to fight it out over the story oftheir loves; and, depend upon it, daybreak will find them at it withouthaving made an end of it.”“So be it by all means,” said Sancho; “and I will tell your worship whoI am, that you may see whether I am to be reckoned among the number ofthe most talkative squires.”With this the two squires withdrew to one side, and between them therepassed a conversation as droll as that which passed between theirmasters was serious.p12e.jpg (15K)CHAPTER XIII.IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE,TOGETHER WITH THE SENSIBLE, ORIGINAL, AND TRANQUIL COLLOQUY THAT PASSEDBETWEEN THE TWO SQUIRESp13a.jpg (126K)Full SizeThe knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the storyof their lives, the others the story of their loves; but the historyrelates first of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwardstakes up that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a littlefrom the others, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “A hard life it is welead and live, señor, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, weeat our bread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses Godlaid on our first parents.”“It may be said, too,” added Sancho, “that we eat it in the chill ofour bodies; for who gets more heat and cold than the miserable squiresof knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had somethingto eat, for woes are lighter if there’s bread; but sometimes we go aday or two without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows.”“All that,” said he of the Grove, “may be endured and put up with whenwe have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he serves isexcessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least findhimself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some faircounty.”“I,” said Sancho, “have already told my master that I shall be contentwith the government of some island, and he is so noble and generousthat he has promised it to me ever so many times.”“I,” said he of the Grove, “shall be satisfied with a canonry for myservices, and my master has already assigned me one.”“Your master,” said Sancho, “no doubt is a knight in the Church line,and can bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; but mine isonly a layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind,designing people, strove to persuade him to try and become anarchbishop. He, however, would not be anything but an emperor; but Iwas trembling all the time lest he should take a fancy to go into theChurch, not finding myself fit to hold office in it; for I may tellyou, though I seem a man, I am no better than a beast for the Church.”“Well, then, you are wrong there,” said he of the Grove; “for thoseisland governments are not all satisfactory; some are awkward, some arepoor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest and choicest bringswith it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the unhappy wight towhose lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far better would itbe for us who have adopted this accursed service to go back to our ownhouses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations—in huntingor fishing, for instance; for what squire in the world is there so pooras not to have a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod toamuse himself with in his own village?”“I am not in want of any of those things,” said Sancho; “to be sure Ihave no hack, but I have an ass that is worth my master’s horse twiceover; God send me a bad Easter, and that the next one I am to see, if Iwould swap, even if I got four bushels of barley to boot. You willlaugh at the value I put on my Dapple—for dapple is the colour of mybeast. As to greyhounds, I can’t want for them, for there are enoughand to spare in my town; and, moreover, there is more pleasure in sportwhen it is at other people’s expense.”“In truth and earnest, sir squire,” said he of the Grove, “I have madeup my mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries ofthese knights, and go back to my village, and bring up my children; forI have three, like three Oriental pearls.”“I have two,” said Sancho, “that might be presented before the Popehimself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for a countess, pleaseGod, though in spite of her mother.”“And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?” askedhe of the Grove.“Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,” answered Sancho; “but she isas tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning, and as strong asa porter.”“Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph ofthe greenwood,” said he of the Grove; “whoreson strumpet! what pith therogue must have!”To which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, “She’s no strumpet, norwas her mother, nor will either of them be, please God, while I live;speak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant, who arecourtesy itself, your words don’t seem to me to be very becoming.”“O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,” returned he ofthe Grove. “What! don’t you know that when a horseman delivers a goodlance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anythingvery well, the people are wont to say, ‘Ha, whoreson rip! how well hehas done it!’ and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is highpraise? Disown sons and daughters, señor, who don’t do what deservesthat compliments of this sort should be paid to their parents.”“I do disown them,” replied Sancho, “and in this way, and by the samereasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all thestrumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that inthe highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again Ipray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the samething, to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which Ihave fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with ahundred ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena;and the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes,here, there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting myhand on it, and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and makinginvestments, and getting interest, and living like a prince; and solong as I think of this I make light of all the hardships I endure withthis simpleton of a master of mine, who, I well know, is more of amadman than a knight.”“There’s why they say that ‘covetousness bursts the bag,’” said he ofthe Grove; “but if you come to talk of that sort, there is not agreater one in the world than my master, for he is one of those of whomthey say, ‘the cares of others kill the ass;’ for, in order thatanother knight may recover the senses he has lost, he makes a madman ofhimself and goes looking for what, when found, may, for all I know, flyin his own face.” “And is he in love perchance?” asked Sancho.“He is,” said of the Grove, “with one Casildea de Vandalia, the rawestand best roasted lady the whole world could produce; but that rawnessis not the only foot he limps on, for he has greater schemes rumblingin his bowels, as will be seen before many hours are over.”“There’s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance in it,”said Sancho; “in other houses they cook beans, but in mine it’s by thepotful; madness will have more followers and hangers-on than soundsense; but if there be any truth in the common saying, that to havecompanions in trouble gives some relief, I may take consolation fromyou, inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my own.”“Crazy but valiant,” replied he of the Grove, “and more roguish thancrazy or valiant.”“Mine is not that,” said Sancho; “I mean he has nothing of the rogue inhim; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has no thoughtof doing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any malicewhatever in him; a child might persuade him that it is night atnoonday; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart,and I can’t bring myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolishthings.”“For all that, brother and señor,” said he of the Grove, “if the blindlead the blind, both are in danger of falling into the pit. It isbetter for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarters;for those who seek adventures don’t always find good ones.”Sancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhatropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grovesaid, “It seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues aresticking to the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosenerhanging from the saddle-bow of my horse,” and getting up he came backthe next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yardacross; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbitso big that Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, notto say a kid, and looking at it he said, “And do you carry this withyou, señor?”“Why, what are you thinking about?” said the other; “do you take me forsome paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse’s croup than ageneral takes with him when he goes on a march.”Sancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark boltedmouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, “You are a propertrusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as thisbanquet shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any ratehas the look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing morein my alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain agiant with it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as manymore filberts and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, andthe idea he has and the rule he follows, that knights-errant must notlive or sustain themselves on anything except dried fruits and theherbs of the field.”“By my faith, brother,” said he of the Grove, “my stomach is not madefor thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods; let our masters doas they like, with their chivalry notions and laws, and eat what thoseenjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to the saddle-bow,whatever they may say; and it is such an object of worship with me, andI love it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissing andembracing it over and over again;” and so saying he thrust it intoSancho’s hands, who raising it aloft pointed to his mouth, gazed at thestars for a quarter of an hour; and when he had done drinking let hishead fall on one side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, “Ah, whoresonrogue, how catholic it is!”“There, you see,” said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho’s exclamation,“how you have called this wine whoreson by way of praise.”“Well,” said Sancho, “I own it, and I grant it is no dishonour to callanyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise. But tell me,señor, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?”“O rare wine-taster!” said he of the Grove; “nowhere else indeed doesit come from, and it has some years’ age too.”“Leave me alone for that,” said Sancho; “never fear but I’ll hit uponthe place it came from somehow. What would you say, sir squire, to myhaving such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you haveonly to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, itskind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, andeverything that appertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I havehad in my family, on my father’s side, the two best wine-tasters thathave been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I’lltell you now a thing that happened them. They gave the two of them somewine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition,quality, goodness or badness of the wine. One of them tried it with thetip of his tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his nose. Thefirst said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had astronger flavour of cordovan. The owner said the cask was clean, andthat nothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got aflavour of either iron or leather. Nevertheless, these two greatwine-tasters held to what they had said. Time went by, the wine wassold, and when they came to clean out the cask, they found in it asmall key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see now if one who comes ofthe same stock has not a right to give his opinion in such like cases.”“Therefore, I say,” said he of the Grove, “let us give up going inquest of adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go looking forcakes, but return to our cribs, for God will find us there if it be hiswill.”“Until my master reaches Saragossa,” said Sancho, “I’ll remain in hisservice; after that we’ll see.”The end of it was that the two squires talked so much and drank so muchthat sleep had to tie their tongues and moderate their thirst, for toquench it was impossible; and so the pair of them fell asleep clingingto the now nearly empty bota and with half-chewed morsels in theirmouths; and there we will leave them for the present, to relate whatpassed between the Knight of the Grove and him of the RuefulCountenance.p13e.jpg (43K)CHAPTER XIV.WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVEp14a.jpg (120K)Full SizeAmong the things that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of theWood, the history tells us he of the Grove said to Don Quixote, “Infine, sir knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, moreproperly speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerlessCasildea de Vandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer,whether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty.This same Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourablepassion and gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother didHercules, to engage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of eachpromising me that, with the end of the next, the object of my hopesshould be attained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by linkuntil they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last onethat is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires.On one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous giantess ofSeville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong as if made ofbrass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the most restlessand changeable woman in the world. I came, I saw, I conquered, and Imade her stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing but north windsblew for more than a week. Another time I was ordered to lift thoseancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an enterprise that mightmore fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights. Again, she bade mefling myself into the cavern of Cabra—an unparalleled and awfulperil—and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in thosegloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the Giralda, I lifted the bullsof Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern and brought to light thesecrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead as dead can be, and herscorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be brief, last of all shehas commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compelall the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpassesall women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant andthe most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim Ihave already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have therevanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what Imost plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combatthat so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confessthat my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this onevictory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world;for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and Ihaving vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passedand are transferred to my person; forThe more the vanquished hath of fair renown,The greater glory gilds the victor’s crown.Thus the innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now setdown to my account and have become mine.”Don Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove, and was athousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the liedirect already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself aswell as he could, in order to force him to confess the lie with his ownlips; so he said to him quietly, “As to what you say, sir knight, abouthaving vanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even of the wholeworld, I say nothing; but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of LaMancha I consider doubtful; it may have been some other that resembledhim, although there are few like him.”“How! not vanquished?” said he of the Grove; “by the heaven that isabove us I fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made him yield; andhe is a man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, withhair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large blackdrooping moustaches; he does battle under the name of ‘TheCountenance,’ and he has for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza; hepresses the loins and rules the reins of a famous steed calledRocinante; and lastly, he has for the mistress of his will a certainDulcinea del Toboso, once upon a time called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as Icall mine Casildea de Vandalia because her name is Casilda and she isof Andalusia. If all these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truthof what I say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself togive credence to it.”“Calm yourself, sir knight,” said Don Quixote, “and give ear to what Iam about to say to you. I would have you know that this Don Quixote youspeak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much so that Imay say I regard him in the same light as my own person; and from theprecise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think that hemust be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see withmy eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have beenthe same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who areenchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him,someone of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself tobe vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exaltedachievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughoutthe known world. And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too,that it is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemiestransformed the shape and person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into afoul and mean village lass, and in the same way they must havetransformed Don Quixote; and if all this does not suffice to convinceyou of the truth of what I say, here is Don Quixote himself, who willmaintain it by arms, on foot or on horseback or in any way you please.”And so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting tosee what the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voicesaid in reply, “Pledges don’t distress a good payer; he who hassucceeded in vanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote,may fairly hope to subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it isnot becoming for knights to perform their feats of arms in the dark,like highwaymen and bullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sunmay behold our deeds; and the conditions of our combat shall be thatthe vanquished shall be at the victor’s disposal, to do all that he mayenjoin, provided the injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.”“I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,” replied DonQuixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where their squireslay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in whensleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the horsesready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous singlecombat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck,trembling for the safety of his master because of the mighty deeds hehad heard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but without a wordthe two squires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time thethree horses and the ass had smelt one another out, and were alltogether.On the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “You must know, brother,that it is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they aregodfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms whiletheir godsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters arefighting, we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.”“That custom, sir squire,” replied Sancho, “may hold good among thosebullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among thesquires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speakof any custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of knight-errantryby heart; but granting it true that there is an express law thatsquires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don’t mean toobey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully mindedsquires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds ofwax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less thanthe lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I lookupon as broken and split already; there’s another thing that makes itimpossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never carriedone in my life.”“I know a good remedy for that,” said he of the Grove; “I have here twolinen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I the other, andwe will fight at bag blows with equal arms.”“If that’s the way, so be it with all my heart,” said Sancho, “for thatsort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us instead ofhurting us.”“That will not do,” said the other, “for we must put into the bags, tokeep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice smooth pebbles,all of the same weight; and in this way we shall be able to baste oneanother without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.”“Body of my father!” said Sancho, “see what marten and sable, and padsof carded cotton he is putting into the bags, that our heads may not bebroken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if they are filled withtoss silk, I can tell you, señor, I am not going to fight; let ourmasters fight, that’s their lookout, and let us drink and live; fortime will take care to ease us of our lives, without our going to lookfor fillips so that they may be finished off before their proper timecomes and they drop from ripeness.”“Still,” returned he of the Grove, “we must fight, if it be only forhalf an hour.”“By no means,” said Sancho; “I am not going to be so discourteous or soungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small, with one I haveeaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bring himself tofight in cold blood, without anger or provocation?”“I can remedy that entirely,” said he of the Grove, “and in this way:before we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship fair andsoftly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall stretchyou at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping sounderthan a dormouse.”“To match that plan,” said Sancho, “I have another that is not a whitbehind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship comes nearenough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep withwhacks, that it won’t waken unless it be in the other world, where itis known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone; leteach look out for the arrow—though the surer way would be to leteveryone’s anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a manmay come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace andhis curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed,turns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; andso from this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm andmischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to youraccount.”“Very good,” said he of the Grove; “God will send the dawn and we shallbe all right.”And now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees,and with their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salutethe fresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenanceat the gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks aprofusion of liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, theplants, too, seemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willowsdistilled sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, thewoods rejoiced, and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their gloryat her coming. But hardly had the light of day made it possible to seeand distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself tothe eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove’s nose, which wasso big that it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact,stated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, coveredwith warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung downtwo fingers’ length below his mouth, and the size, the colour, thewarts, and the bend of it, made his face so hideous, that Sancho, as helooked at him, began to tremble hand and foot like a child inconvulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let himself be given twohundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster. DonQuixote examined his adversary, and found that he already had hishelmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his face; heobserved, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tallin stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemedto be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrorslike little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendidappearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes,green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against atree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palmin length.Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he sawand observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of greatstrength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like SanchoPanza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said tothe Knight of the Mirrors, “If, sir knight, your great eagerness tofight has not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you toraise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness ofyour countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.”“Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sirknight,” replied he of the Mirrors, “you will have more than enoughtime and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with yourrequest, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong tothe fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raisemy visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware Imaintain.”“Well then,” said Don Quixote, “while we are mounting you can at leasttell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.”“To that we answer you,” said he of the Mirrors, “that you are as likethe very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you sayenchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whetheryou are the said person or not.”“That,” said Don Quixote, “is enough to convince me that you are undera deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses bebrought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor,if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see yourface, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote youtake me to be.”With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixotewheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to chargeback upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but DonQuixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called bythe other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him,“Remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that thevanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor’s disposal.”“I am aware of it already,” said Don Quixote; “provided what iscommanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do nottransgress the limits of chivalry.”“That is understood,” replied he of the Mirrors.At this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself toDon Quixote’s view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at the sight;insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a humanbeing of some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his masterretiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosyman, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battlewould be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground,either by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holdingon to Rocinante’s stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time toturn about, he said, “I implore of your worship, señor, before you turnto charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be ableto witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have withthis knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.”“It seems to me rather, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thou wouldstmount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.”“To tell the truth,” returned Sancho, “the monstrous nose of thatsquire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay nearhim.”“It is,” said Don Quixote, “such a one that were I not what I am itwould terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt.”While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he ofthe Mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and,supposing Don Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for anysound of trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse,which was not more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at histop speed, which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy;seeing him, however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, andhalted in mid career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he wasalready unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was comingdown upon him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante’s leanflanks and made him scud along in such style that the history tells usthat on this occasion only was he known to make something like running,for on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with thisunparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digginghis spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make himstir a finger’s length from the spot where he had come to a standstillin his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came uponhis adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with hislance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in rest.Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties, and inperfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him of theMirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in spite ofhimself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a fall thathe lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot. The instantSancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and made all hasteto where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante, went andstood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see if he wasdead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw—whocan say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment,wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says, the very countenance, thevery face, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, thevery image of the bachelor Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it hecalled out in a loud voice, “Make haste here, Sancho, and behold whatthou art to see but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magiccan do, and wizards and enchanters are capable of.”Sancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelorCarrasco, he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessinghimself as many more. All this time the prostrate knight showed nosigns of life, and Sancho said to Don Quixote, “It is my opinion,señor, that in any case your worship should take and thrust your swordinto the mouth of this one here that looks like the bachelor SamsonCarrasco; perhaps in him you will kill one of your enemies, theenchanters.”“Thy advice is not bad,” said Don Quixote, “for of enemies the fewerthe better;” and he was drawing his sword to carry into effect Sancho’scounsel and suggestion, when the squire of the Mirrors came up, nowwithout the nose which had made him so hideous, and cried out in a loudvoice, “Mind what you are about, Señor Don Quixote; that is yourfriend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I amhis squire.”“And the nose?” said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature hehad before; to which he replied, “I have it here in my pocket,” andputting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade noseof varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho,examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice ofamazement, “Holy Mary be good to me! Isn’t it Tom Cecial, my neighbourand gossip?”“Why, to be sure I am!” returned the now unnosed squire; “Tom Cecial Iam, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I’ll tell you presently themeans and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; butin the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat,wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet;because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelorSamson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.”At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixoteperceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, andsaid to him, “You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia inbeauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survivethis encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and presentyourself before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according toher good pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are inlike manner to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deedswill serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell mewhat may have passed between you and her—conditions which, inaccordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgressthe just limits of knight-errantry.”“I confess,” said the fallen knight, “that the dirty tattered shoe ofthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though cleanbeard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presenceto yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all youdemand of me.”“You must also confess and believe,” added Don Quixote, “that theknight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of LaMancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess and believethat you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are notso, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put beforeme in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate thevehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of myvictory.”“I confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, andthink it,” the crippled knight; “let me rise, I entreat you; if,indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in asorry plight enough.”Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire TomCecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he putquestions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he wasreally and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made onSancho’s mind by what his master said about the enchanters havingchanged the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelorSamson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw with hiseyes. In fine, both master and man remained under the delusion; and,down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squireparted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go look for somevillage where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don Quixote andSancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the history leavesthem in order that it may tell who the Knight of the Mirrors and hislong-nosed squire were.p14e.jpg (56K)CHAPTER XV.WHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HISSQUIRE WEREp15a.jpg (122K)Full SizeDon Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in thehighest degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as hefancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word heexpected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued;inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty ofceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what tookplace between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of theMirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything butfinding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been saidalready. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelorSamson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantrywhich he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having beenpreviously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means tobe adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quietwithout worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at whichconsultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on thespecial advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sallyforth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for therewould be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that beinglooked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settledthat the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor. Then, DonQuixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command him toreturn to his village and his house, and not quit it for two years, oruntil he received further orders from him; all which it was clear DonQuixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or fail toobserve the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his seclusion hemight perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an opportunity ofdiscovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco undertook thetask, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho Panza’s, alively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his squire. Carrascoarmed himself in the fashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he mightnot be known by his gossip when they met, fitted on over his ownnatural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned; and sothey followed the same route Don Quixote took, and almost came up withhim in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of Death andfinally encountered them in the grove, where all that the sagaciousreader has been reading about took place; and had it not been for theextraordinary fancies of Don Quixote, and his conviction that thebachelor was not the bachelor, señor bachelor would have beenincapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate, allthrough not finding nests where he thought to find birds.Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry endtheir expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, “Sure enough, SeñorSamson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and setabout an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come wellout of it. Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing,safe, and sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I’d like to know nowwhich is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he whois so of his own choice?”To which Samson replied, “The difference between the two sorts ofmadmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, whilehe who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever helikes.”“In that case,” said Tom Cecial, “I was a madman of my own accord whenI volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I’ll leaveoff being one and go home.”“That’s your affair,” returned Samson, “but to suppose that I am goinghome until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it isnot any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt himout now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won’t let meentertain more charitable thoughts.”Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where itwas their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help theunfortunate Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, whilehe stayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return tohim again at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with DonQuixote now.p15e.jpg (17K)CHAPTER XVI.OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHAp16a.jpg (85K)Full SizeDon Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, andself-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorousknight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. Allthe adventures that could befall him from that time forth he regardedas already done and brought to a happy issue; he made light ofenchantments and enchanters; he thought no more of the countlessdrubbings that had been administered to him in the course of hisknight-errantry, nor of the volley of stones that had levelled half histeeth, nor of the ingratitude of the galley slaves, nor of the audacityof the Yanguesans and the shower of stakes that fell upon him; inshort, he said to himself that could he discover any means, mode, orway of disenchanting his lady Dulcinea, he would not envy the highestfortune that the most fortunate knight-errant of yore ever reached orcould reach.He was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when Sancho saidto him, “Isn’t it odd, señor, that I have still before my eyes thatmonstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom Cecial?”“And dost thou, then, believe, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that theKnight of the Mirrors was the bachelor Carrasco, and his squire TomCecial thy gossip?”“I don’t know what to say to that,” replied Sancho; “all I know is thatthe tokens he gave me about my own house, wife and children, nobodyelse but himself could have given me; and the face, once the nose wasoff, was the very face of Tom Cecial, as I have seen it many a time inmy town and next door to my own house; and the sound of the voice wasjust the same.”“Let us reason the matter, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “Come now, bywhat process of thinking can it be supposed that the bachelor SamsonCarrasco would come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive anddefensive, to fight with me? Have I ever been by any chance his enemy?Have I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge? Am I his rival,or does he profess arms, that he should envy the fame I have acquiredin them?”“Well, but what are we to say, señor,” returned Sancho, “about thatknight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelor Carrasco, and hissquire so like my gossip, Tom Cecial? And if that be enchantment, asyour worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them totake the likeness of?”“It is all,” said Don Quixote, “a scheme and plot of the malignantmagicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that I was to bevictorious in the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight shoulddisplay the countenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that thefriendship I bear him should interpose to stay the edge of my sword andmight of my arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he whosought to take my life by fraud and falsehood should save his own. Andto prove it, thou knowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannotlie or deceive, how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenanceinto another, turning fair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is nottwo days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and eleganceof the peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony,while I saw her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse countrywench, with cataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; andwhen the perverse enchanter ventured to effect so wicked atransformation, it is no wonder if he effected that of Samson Carrascoand thy gossip in order to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp.For all that, however, I console myself, because, after all, inwhatever shape he may have been, I have been victorious over my enemy.”“God knows what’s the truth of it all,” said Sancho; and knowing as hedid that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a device andimposition of his own, his master’s illusions were not satisfactory tohim; but he did not like to reply lest he should say something thatmight disclose his trickery.As they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a manwho was following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsomeflea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, withtawny velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappingsof the mare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberrycolour and green. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broadgreen and gold baldric; the buskins were of the same make as thebaldric; the spurs were not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightlypolished that, matching as they did the rest of his apparel, theylooked better than if they had been of pure gold.When the traveller came up with them he saluted them courteously, andspurring his mare was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixotecalled out to him, “Gallant sir, if so be your worship is going ourroad, and has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if wewere to join company.”“In truth,” replied he on the mare, “I would not pass you so hastilybut for fear that horse might turn restive in the company of my mare.”“You may safely hold in your mare, señor,” said Sancho in reply tothis, “for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved horse in theworld; he never does anything wrong on such occasions, and the onlytime he misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; I sayagain your worship may pull up if you like; for if she was offered tohim between two plates the horse would not hanker after her.”The traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of DonQuixote, who rode without his helmet, which Sancho carried like avalise in front of Dapple’s pack-saddle; and if the man in greenexamined Don Quixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixoteexamine the man in green, who struck him as being a man ofintelligence. In appearance he was about fifty years of age, with butfew grey hairs, an aquiline cast of features, and an expression betweengrave and gay; and his dress and accoutrements showed him to be a manof good condition. What he in green thought of Don Quixote of La Manchawas that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen; hemarvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty stature, the lanknessand sallowness of his countenance, his armour, his bearing and hisgravity—a figure and picture such as had not been seen in those regionsfor many a long day.Don Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller wasregarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; andcourteous as he was and ready to please everybody, before the othercould ask him any question he anticipated him by saying, “Theappearance I present to your worship being so strange and so out of thecommon, I should not be surprised if it filled you with wonder; but youwill cease to wonder when I tell you, as I do, that I am one of thoseknights who, as people say, go seeking adventures. I have left my home,I have mortgaged my estate, I have given up my comforts, and committedmyself to the arms of Fortune, to bear me whithersoever she may please.My desire was to bring to life again knight-errantry, now dead, and forsome time past, stumbling here, falling there, now coming downheadlong, now raising myself up again, I have carried out a greatportion of my design, succouring widows, protecting maidens, and givingaid to wives, orphans, and minors, the proper and natural duty ofknights-errant; and, therefore, because of my many valiant andChristian achievements, I have been already found worthy to make my wayin print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the earth. Thirtythousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is on thehigh-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if heavendoes not put a stop to it. In short, to sum up all in a few words, orin a single one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,otherwise called ‘The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;’ for thoughself-praise is degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, thatis to say, when there is no one at hand to do it for me. So that,gentle sir, neither this horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, northis squire, nor all these arms put together, nor the sallowness of mycountenance, nor my gaunt leanness, will henceforth astonish you, nowthat you know who I am and what profession I follow.”With these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he tookto answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after along pause, however, he said to him, “You were right when you sawcuriosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded inremoving the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say,señor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so;on the contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonishedthan before. What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in theworld in these days, and histories of real chivalry printed? I cannotrealise the fact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aidswidows, or protects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; norshould I believe it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes.Blessed be heaven! for by means of this history of your noble andgenuine chivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countlessstories of fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, somuch to the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of goodhistories, will have been driven into oblivion.”“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don Quixote, “asto whether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not.”“Why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?” saidthe man in green.“I doubt it,” said Don Quixote, “but never mind that just now; if ourjourney lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall show your worshipthat you do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as amatter of certainty that they are not true.”From this last observation of Don Quixote’s, the traveller began tohave a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for himto confirm it by something further; but before they could turn to anynew subject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since hehimself had rendered account of his station and life. To this, he inthe green gaban replied “I, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am agentleman by birth, native of the village where, please God, we aregoing to dine to-day; I am more than fairly well off, and my name isDon Diego de Miranda. I pass my life with my wife, children, andfriends; my pursuits are hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawksnor greyhounds, nothing but a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two; Ihave six dozen or so of books, some in our mother tongue, some Latin,some of them history, others devotional; those of chivalry have not asyet crossed the threshold of my door; I am more given to turning overthe profane than the devotional, so long as they are books of honestentertainment that charm by their style and attract and interest by theinvention they display, though of these there are very few in Spain.Sometimes I dine with my neighbours and friends, and often invite them;my entertainments are neat and well served without stint of anything. Ihave no taste for tattle, nor do I allow tattling in my presence; I prynot into my neighbours’ lives, nor have I lynx-eyes for what others do.I hear mass every day; I share my substance with the poor, making nodisplay of good works, lest I let hypocrisy and vainglory, thoseenemies that subtly take possession of the most watchful heart, find anentrance into mine. I strive to make peace between those whom I know tobe at variance; I am the devoted servant of Our Lady, and my trust isever in the infinite mercy of God our Lord.”Sancho listened with the greatest attention to the account of thegentleman’s life and occupation; and thinking it a good and a holylife, and that he who led it ought to work miracles, he threw himselfoff Dapple, and running in haste seized his right stirrup and kissedhis foot again and again with a devout heart and almost with tears.Seeing this the gentleman asked him, “What are you about, brother? Whatare these kisses for?”“Let me kiss,” said Sancho, “for I think your worship is the firstsaint in the saddle I ever saw all the days of my life.”“I am no saint,” replied the gentleman, “but a great sinner; but youare, brother, for you must be a good fellow, as your simplicity shows.”Sancho went back and regained his pack-saddle, having extracted a laughfrom his master’s profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazement inDon Diego. Don Quixote then asked him how many children he had, andobserved that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, whowere without the true knowledge of God, placed the _summum bonum_ wasin the gifts of nature, in those of fortune, in having many friends,and many and good children.“I, Señor Don Quixote,” answered the gentleman, “have one son, withoutwhom, perhaps, I should count myself happier than I am, not because heis a bad son, but because he is not so good as I could wish. He iseighteen years of age; he has been for six at Salamanca studying Latinand Greek, and when I wished him to turn to the study of other sciencesI found him so wrapped up in that of poetry (if that can be called ascience) that there is no getting him to take kindly to the law, whichI wished him to study, or to theology, the queen of them all. I wouldlike him to be an honour to his family, as we live in days when ourkings liberally reward learning that is virtuous and worthy; forlearning without virtue is a pearl on a dunghill. He spends the wholeday in settling whether Homer expressed himself correctly or not insuch and such a line of the Iliad, whether Martial was indecent or notin such and such an epigram, whether such and such lines of Virgil areto be understood in this way or in that; in short, all his talk is ofthe works of these poets, and those of Horace, Perseus, Juvenal, andTibullus; for of the moderns in our own language he makes no greataccount; but with all his seeming indifference to Spanish poetry, justnow his thoughts are absorbed in making a gloss on four lines that havebeen sent him from Salamanca, which I suspect are for some poeticaltournament.”To all this Don Quixote said in reply, “Children, señor, are portionsof their parents’ bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to beloved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents toguide them from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthyChristian conduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of theirparents’ old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force themto study this or that science I do not think wise, though it may be noharm to persuade them; and when there is no need to study for the sakeof _pane lucrando_, and it is the student’s good fortune that heavenhas given him parents who provide him with it, it would be my advice tothem to let him pursue whatever science they may see him most inclinedto; and though that of poetry is less useful than pleasurable, it isnot one of those that bring discredit upon the possessor. Poetry,gentle sir, is, as I take it, like a tender young maiden of supremebeauty, to array, bedeck, and adorn whom is the task of several othermaidens, who are all the rest of the sciences; and she must availherself of the help of all, and all derive their lustre from her. Butthis maiden will not bear to be handled, nor dragged through thestreets, nor exposed either at the corners of the market-places, or inthe closets of palaces. She is the product of an Alchemy of such virtuethat he who is able to practise it, will turn her into pure gold ofinestimable worth. He that possesses her must keep her within bounds,not permitting her to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets.She must on no account be offered for sale, unless, indeed, it be inheroic poems, moving tragedies, or sprightly and ingenious comedies.She must not be touched by the buffoons, nor by the ignorant vulgar,incapable of comprehending or appreciating her hidden treasures. And donot suppose, señor, that I apply the term vulgar here merely toplebeians and the lower orders; for everyone who is ignorant, be helord or prince, may and should be included among the vulgar. He, then,who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I havenamed, shall become famous, and his name honoured throughout all thecivilised nations of the earth. And with regard to what you say, señor,of your son having no great opinion of Spanish poetry, I am inclined tothink that he is not quite right there, and for this reason: the greatpoet Homer did not write in Latin, because he was a Greek, nor didVirgil write in Greek, because he was a Latin; in short, all theancient poets wrote in the language they imbibed with their mother’smilk, and never went in quest of foreign ones to express their sublimeconceptions; and that being so, the usage should in justice extend toall nations, and the German poet should not be undervalued because hewrites in his own language, nor the Castilian, nor even the Biscayan,for writing in his. But your son, señor, I suspect, is not prejudicedagainst Spanish poetry, but against those poets who are mere Spanishverse writers, without any knowledge of other languages or sciences toadorn and give life and vigour to their natural inspiration; and yeteven in this he may be wrong; for, according to a true belief, a poetis born one; that is to say, the poet by nature comes forth a poet fromhis mother’s womb; and following the bent that heaven has bestowed uponhim, without the aid of study or art, he produces things that show howtruly he spoke who said, ‘_Est Deus in nobis_,’ etc. At the same time,I say that the poet by nature who calls in art to his aid will be a farbetter poet, and will surpass him who tries to be one relying upon hisknowledge of art alone. The reason is, that art does not surpassnature, but only brings it to perfection; and thus, nature combinedwith art, and art with nature, will produce a perfect poet. To bring myargument to a close, I would say then, gentle sir, let your son go onas his star leads him, for being so studious as he seems to be, andhaving already successfully surmounted the first step of the sciences,which is that of the languages, with their help he will by his ownexertions reach the summit of polite literature, which so well becomesan independent gentleman, and adorns, honours, and distinguishes him,as much as the mitre does the bishop, or the gown the learnedcounsellor. If your son write satires reflecting on the honour ofothers, chide and correct him, and tear them up; but if he composediscourses in which he rebukes vice in general, in the style of Horace,and with elegance like his, commend him; for it is legitimate for apoet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse, and theother vices too, provided he does not single out individuals; thereare, however, poets who, for the sake of saying something spiteful,would run the risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus. If thepoet be pure in his morals, he will be pure in his verses too; the penis the tongue of the mind, and as the thought engendered there, so willbe the things that it writes down. And when kings and princes observethis marvellous science of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtfulsubjects, they honour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with theleaves of that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to showthat they whose brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown arenot to be assailed by anyone.”He of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote’sargument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had takenup about his being crazy. But in the middle of the discourse, it beingnot very much to his taste, Sancho had turned aside out of the road tobeg a little milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hardby; and just as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew theconversation, Don Quixote, raising his head, perceived a cart coveredwith royal flags coming along the road they were travelling; andpersuaded that this must be some new adventure, he called aloud toSancho to come and bring him his helmet. Sancho, hearing himselfcalled, quitted the shepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came upto his master, to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.p16e.jpg (49K)CHAPTER XVII.WHEREIN IS SHOWN THE FURTHEST AND HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE UNEXAMPLEDCOURAGE OF DON QUIXOTE REACHED OR COULD REACH; TOGETHER WITH THEHAPPILY ACHIEVED ADVENTURE OF THE LIONSp17a.jpg (137K)Full SizeThe history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bringhim his helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed tosell him, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did notknow what to do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to losethem, for he had already paid for them, he thought it best to throwthem into his master’s helmet, and acting on this bright idea he wentto see what his master wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimedto him:“Give me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little ofadventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, callupon me to arm myself.”He of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, butcould perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two orthree small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carryingtreasure of the King’s, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however,would not believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that allthat happened to him must be adventures and still more adventures; sohe replied to the gentleman, “He who is prepared has his battle halffought; nothing is lost by my preparing myself, for I know byexperience that I have enemies, visible and invisible, and I know notwhen, or where, or at what moment, or in what shapes they will attackme;” and turning to Sancho, he called for his helmet; and Sancho, as hehad no time to take out the curds, had to give it just as it was. DonQuixote took it, and without perceiving what was in it thrust it downin hot haste upon his head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezedthe whey began to run all over his face and beard, whereat he was sostartled that he cried out to Sancho:“Sancho, what’s this? I think my head is softening, or my brains aremelting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweating it is notindeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventurewhich is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something towipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blindingme.”Sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God atthe same time that his master had not found out what was the matter.Don Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what itwas that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mashinside his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt ithe exclaimed:“By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hastput here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!”To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied,“If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I’ll eat them;but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put themthere. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offenderfinely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must haveenchanters too, that persecute me as a creature and limb of yourworship, and they must have put that nastiness there in order toprovoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you arewont to do. Well, this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for Itrust to my master’s good sense to see that I have got no curds ormilk, or anything of the sort; and that if I had it is in my stomach Iwould put it and not in the helmet.”“May be so,” said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman was observing,and with astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped himselfclean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on, andsettling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in thescabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, “Now, come who will, heream I, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!”By this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyoneexcept the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixoteplanted himself before it and said, “Whither are you going, brothers?What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?”To this the carter replied, “The cart is mine; what is in it is a pairof wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court asa present to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King’s, toshow that what is here is his property.”“And are the lions large?” asked Don Quixote.“So large,” replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, “thatlarger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am thekeeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these. Theyare male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female inthe one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothingto-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to theplace where we are to feed them.”Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, “Lion-whelps to me!to me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! thosegentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightenedby lions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open thecages, and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain Iwill let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in theteeth of the enchanters who send them to me.”“So, so,” said the gentleman to himself at this; “our worthy knight hasshown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skulland brought his brains to a head.”At this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, “Señor, for God’s sakedo something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these lions;for if he does they’ll tear us all to pieces here.”“Is your master then so mad,” asked the gentleman, “that you believeand are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?”“He is not mad,” said Sancho, “but he is venturesome.”“I will prevent it,” said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote,who was insisting upon the keeper’s opening the cages, he said to him,“Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encouragethe hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it;for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness thanof courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor dothey dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his Majesty,and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.”“Gentle sir,” replied Don Quixote, “you go and mind your tame partridgeand your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own business;this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to meor not;” and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, “By all that’sgood, sir scoundrel, if you don’t open the cages this very instant,I’ll pin you to the cart with this lance.”The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, saidto him, “Please your worship, for charity’s sake, señor, let me unyokethe mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lionsare turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life, forall I possess is this cart and mules.”“O man of little faith,” replied Don Quixote, “get down and unyoke; youwill soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that youmight have spared yourself the trouble.”The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and thekeeper called out at the top of his voice, “I call all here to witnessthat against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let thelions loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountablefor all the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for mysalary and dues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safetybefore I open, for I know they will do me no harm.”Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such amad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly.To this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. Thegentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was undera delusion.“Well, señor,” answered Don Quixote, “if you do not like to be aspectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur yourflea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.”Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up anenterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awfulone of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attemptedin the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. “Look ye,señor,” said Sancho, “there’s no enchantment here, nor anything of thesort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the pawof a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw couldbelong to must be bigger than a mountain.”“Fear at any rate,” replied Don Quixote, “will make him look bigger tothee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I diehere thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea—I sayno more.” To these he added some further words that banished all hopeof his giving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would haveoffered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, anddid not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such DonQuixote now showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter,renewing his commands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gavewarning to the gentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and thecarter his mules, all striving to get away from the cart as far as theycould before the lions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over hismaster’s death, for this time he firmly believed it was in store forhim from the claws of the lions; and he cursed his fate and called itan unlucky hour when he thought of taking service with him again; butwith all his tears and lamentations he did not forget to thrash Dappleso as to put a good space between himself and the cart. The keeper,seeing that the fugitives were now some distance off, once moreentreated and warned him as before; but he replied that he heard him,and that he need not trouble himself with any further warnings orentreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade him make haste.During the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the firstcage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to dobattle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fighton foot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of thelions; he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, bracedhis buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly withmarvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in frontof the cart, commending himself with all his heart to God and to hislady Dulcinea.It is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author ofthis veracious history breaks out into exclamations. “O doughty DonQuixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes ofthe world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, oncethe glory and honour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall Idescribe this dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credibleto ages to come, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though theybe hyperboles piled on hyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted,high-souled, with but a simple sword, and that no trenchant blade ofthe Perrillo brand, a shield, but no bright polished steel one, therestoodst thou, biding and awaiting the two fiercest lions that Africa’sforests ever bred! Thy own deeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, andhere I leave them as they stand, wanting the words wherewith to glorifythem!”p17b.jpg (352K)Full SizeHere the author’s outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take upthe thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that DonQuixote had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for himto avoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fieryand daring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing,as has been said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size,and grim and hideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round inthe cage in which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himselfthoroughly; he next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, andwith near two palms’ length of tongue that he had thrust forth, helicked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face; having done this,he put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes likeglowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerityitself. Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him toleap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hopedto hew him in pieces.So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, morecourteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado,after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about andpresented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly andtranquilly lay down again in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote orderedthe keeper to take a stick to him and provoke him to make him come out.“That I won’t,” said the keeper; “for if I anger him, the first he’lltear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied, sir knight, with what youhave done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score ofcourage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time. The lion hasthe door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he hasnot come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship’s greatcourage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so itstrikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait forhim on the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies thedisgrace, and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “close the door, my friend, and letme have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by wayof certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that Iwaited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited for him,and that still he did not come out, and lay down again. I am not boundto do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth,and true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signalsto the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploitfrom thy lips.”The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lancethe cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds,proceeded to recall the others, who still continued to fly, lookingback at every step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear.Sancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth,exclaimed, “May I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts,for he is calling to us.”They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was makingsignals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approachedslowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote’svoice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as theycame up, Don Quixote said to the carter, “Put your mules to once more,brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him twogold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delaythey have incurred through me.”“That will I give with all my heart,” said Sancho; “but what has becomeof the lions? Are they dead or alive?”The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end ofthe contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valourof Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would notand dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door openever so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having representedto the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order toforce him out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, andaltogether against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.“What dost thou think of this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote. “Are thereany enchantments that can prevail against true valour? The enchantersmay be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and couragethey cannot.”Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed DonQuixote’s hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to givean account of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as hesaw him at court.“Then,” said Don Quixote, “if his Majesty should happen to ask whoperformed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desirethat into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the RuefulCountenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed,and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant,who changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited theirpurpose.”The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the greengaban went theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken aword, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that DonQuixote did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a manof brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The firstpart of his history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, theamazement with which his words and deeds filled him would havevanished, as he would then have understood the nature of his madness;but knowing nothing of it, he took him to be rational one moment, andcrazy the next, for what he said was sensible, elegant, and wellexpressed, and what he did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he tohimself, “What could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds,and then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one’s skull;or what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lionstooth and nail?”Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy bysaying, “No doubt, Señor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in yourmind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, formy deeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would have youtake notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must haveseemed to you. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lanceto bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, inthe midst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed inglittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyoustournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain,divert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes bywarlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage thanall these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts,solitudes, cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilousadventures, bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue, allto win a glorious and lasting renown. To greater advantage, I maintain,does the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonelywaste, than the court knight dallying with some city damsel. Allknights have their own special parts to play; let the courtier devotehimself to the ladies, let him add lustre to his sovereign’s court byhis liveries, let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fareof his table, let him arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and provehimself noble, generous, and magnificent, and above all a goodChristian, and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especiallyhis; but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth andpenetrate the most intricate labyrinths, at each step let him attemptimpossibilities, on desolate heaths let him endure the burning rays ofthe midsummer sun, and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds andfrosts; let no lions daunt him, no monsters terrify him, no dragonsmake him quail; for to seek these, to attack those, and to vanquishall, are in truth his main duties. I, then, as it has fallen to my lotto be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid attempting all that tome seems to come within the sphere of my duties; thus it was my boundenduty to attack those lions that I just now attacked, although I knew itto be the height of rashness; for I know well what valour is, that itis a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes,cowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for him who isvaliant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than to sinkuntil he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for theprodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for arash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to truevalour; and believe me, Señor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it isbetter to lose by a card too many than by a card too few; for to hearit said, ‘such a knight is rash and daring,’ sounds better than ‘such aknight is timid and cowardly.’”“I protest, Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Diego, “everything you havesaid and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and Ibelieve, if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost,they might be found in your worship’s breast as in their own properdepository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach myvillage, where you shall take rest after your late exertions; for ifthey have not been of the body they have been of the spirit, and thesesometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue.”“I take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Señor Don Diego,”replied Don Quixote; and pressing forward at a better pace than before,at about two in the afternoon they reached the village and house of DonDiego, or, as Don Quixote called him, “The Knight of the Green Gaban.”p17e.jpg (76K)CHAPTER XVIII.OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OFTHE GREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMONp18a.jpg (133K)Full SizeDon Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda’s house built in village style,with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was thestore-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jarsstanding round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to hismemory his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and notthinking of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, heexclaimed-“O ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!Once sweet and welcome when ’twas heaven’s good-will.“O ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory thesweet object of my bitter regrets!”p18b.jpg (300K)Full SizeThe student poet, Don Diego’s son, who had come out with his mother toreceive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son werefilled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he,however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness toask permission to kiss the lady’s hand, while Don Diego said, “Señora,pray receive with your wonted kindness Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest inthe world.”The lady, whose name was Doña Christina, received him with every signof good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at herservice with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almostthe same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, wholistening to Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headedperson.Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego’smansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a richgentleman-farmer’s house; but the translator of the history thought itbest to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence,as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, thestrong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions.They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour,leaving him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, allstained with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one ofscholastic cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, andhis shoes polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric ofsea-wolf’s skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from anailment of the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good greycloth. But first of all, with five or six buckets of water (for asregard the number of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his headand face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks toSancho’s greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned hismaster so white. Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallantair, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student waswaiting to entertain him while the table was being laid; for on thearrival of so distinguished a guest, Doña Christina was anxious to showthat she knew how and was able to give a becoming reception to thosewho came to her house.While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so DonDiego’s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father,“What are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us,sir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as aknight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.”“I don’t know what to say, my son,” replied. Don Diego; “all I can tellthee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in theworld, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface andundo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits,and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canstas to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am moreinclined to take him to be mad than sane.”With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has beensaid, and in the course of the conversation that passed between themDon Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, “Your father, Señor Don Diego deMiranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect youpossess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.”“A poet, it may be,” replied Don Lorenzo, “but a great one, by nomeans. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to readinggood poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of ‘great’ whichmy father gives me.”“I do not dislike that modesty,” said Don Quixote; “for there is nopoet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in theworld.”“There is no rule without an exception,” said Don Lorenzo; “there maybe some who are poets and yet do not think they are.”“Very few,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me, what verses are those whichyou have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhatrestless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know something aboutglosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a poeticaltournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the firstalways goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simplejustice; and so the third comes to be the second, and the first,reckoning in this way, will be third, in the same way as licentiatedegrees are conferred at the universities; but, for all that, the titleof first is a great distinction.”“So far,” said Don Lorenzo to himself, “I should not take you to be amadman; but let us go on.” So he said to him, “Your worship hasapparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?”“That of knight-errantry,” said Don Quixote, “which is as good as thatof poetry, and even a finger or two above it.”“I do not know what science that is,” said Don Lorenzo, “and until nowI have never heard of it.”“It is a science,” said Don Quixote, “that comprehends in itself all ormost of the sciences in the world, for he who professes it must be ajurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable,so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him. Hemust be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and distinctivereason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever it may be askedof him. He must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as inwastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property ofhealing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for someone tocure him at every step. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by thestars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime andquarter of the world he is in. He must know mathematics, for at everyturn some occasion for them will present itself to him; and, putting itaside that he must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal andtheological, to come down to minor particulars, he must, I say, be ableto swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could, as the storygoes; he must know how to shoe a horse, and repair his saddle andbridle; and, to return to higher matters, he must be faithful to Godand to his lady; he must be pure in thought, decorous in words,generous in works, valiant in deeds, patient in suffering,compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder of the truththough its defence should cost him his life. Of all these qualities,great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then, Señor DonLorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight whostudies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not comparewith the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.”“If that be so,” replied Don Lorenzo, “this science, I protest,surpasses all.”“How, if that be so?” said Don Quixote.“What I mean to say,” said Don Lorenzo, “is, that I doubt whether thereare now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with suchvirtues.”“Many a time,” replied Don Quixote, “have I said what I now say oncemore, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there neverwere any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unlessheaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there wereand are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience hasoften proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the erroryou share with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven todeliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessaryknights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be inthese days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people,sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant.”“Our guest has broken out on our hands,” said Don Lorenzo to himself atthis point; “but, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I shouldbe a dull blockhead to doubt it.”Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.Don Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to thewits of their guest. To which he replied, “All the doctors and cleverscribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness;he is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.”They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said onthe road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful,and tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silencethat reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusianmonastery.When the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, DonQuixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses forthe poetical tournament, to which he replied, “Not to be like thosepoets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and whenthey are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, forwhich I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as anexercise of ingenuity.”“A discerning friend of mine,” said Don Quixote, “was of opinion thatno one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he gavewas that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often ormost frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed atin the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were toostrict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor ‘said he,’ nor ‘Isay,’ nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, notto speak of other restrictions and limitations that fettergloss-writers, as you no doubt know.”“Verily, Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Lorenzo, “I wish I could catchyour worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip throughmy fingers like an eel.”“I don’t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,” said DonQuixote.“I will explain myself another time,” said Don Lorenzo; “for thepresent pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss, which runthus:Could ‘was’ become an ‘is’ for me,Then would I ask no more than this;Or could, for me, the time that isBecome the time that is to be!—GLOSSDame Fortune once upon a dayTo me was bountiful and kind;But all things change; she changed her mind,And what she gave she took away.O Fortune, long I’ve sued to thee;The gifts thou gavest me restore,For, trust me, I would ask no more,Could ‘was’ become an ‘is’ for me.No other prize I seek to gain,No triumph, glory, or success,Only the long-lost happiness,The memory whereof is pain.One taste, methinks, of bygone blissThe heart-consuming fire might stay;And, so it come without delay,Then would I ask no more than this.I ask what cannot be, alas!That time should ever be, and thenCome back to us, and be again,No power on earth can bring to pass;For fleet of foot is he, I wis,And idly, therefore, do we prayThat what for aye hath left us mayBecome for us the time that is.Perplexed, uncertain, to remain’Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life;’Twere better, sure, to end the strife,And dying, seek release from pain.And yet, thought were the best for me.Anon the thought aside I fling,And to the present fondly cling,And dread the time that is to be.”When Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up,and in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped DonLorenzo’s right hand in his, “By the highest heavens, noble youth, butyou are the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel,not by Cyprus or by Gaeta—as a certain poet, God forgive him, said—butby the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those thatflourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judgeswho rob you of the first prize—that Phœbus may pierce them with hisarrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeatme some of your long-measure verses, señor, if you will be so good, forI want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.”Is there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himselfpraised by Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power offlattery, how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thypleasant jurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he compliedwith Don Quixote’s request and entreaty, and repeated to him thissonnet on the fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe.SONNETThe lovely maid, she pierces now the wall;Heart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie;And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly,A chink to view so wondrous great and small.There silence speaketh, for no voice at allCan pass so strait a strait; but love will plyWhere to all other power ’twere vain to try;For love will find a way whate’er befall.Impatient of delay, with reckless paceThe rash maid wins the fatal spot where sheSinks not in lover’s arms but death’s embrace.So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twainOne sword, one sepulchre, one memory,Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.“Blessed be God,” said Don Quixote when he had heard Don Lorenzo’ssonnet, “that among the hosts there are of irritable poets I have foundone consummate one, which, señor, the art of this sonnet proves to methat you are!”For four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in DonDiego’s house, at the end of which time he asked his permission todepart, telling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality hehad received in his house, but that, as it did not becomeknights-errant to give themselves up for long to idleness and luxury,he was anxious to fulfill the duties of his calling in seekingadventures, of which he was informed there was an abundance in thatneighbourhood, where he hoped to employ his time until the day cameround for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his proper destination;and that, first of all, he meant to enter the cave of Montesinos, ofwhich so many marvellous things were reported all through the country,and at the same time to investigate and explore the origin and truesource of the seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera.Don Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade himfurnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, asthey would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, hispersonal worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.The day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote asit was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfiedwith the abundance of Don Diego’s house, and objected to return to thestarvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of hisill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what heconsidered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo,“I know not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell youonce more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil inreaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you havenothing to do but to turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path ofpoetry and take the still narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough,however, to make you an emperor in the twinkling of an eye.”In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, butstill better in what he added when he said, “God knows, I would gladlytake Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, andtrample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of theprofession I belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it,nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myselfwith impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as apoet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by yourown; because no fathers or mothers ever think their own childrenill-favoured, and this sort of deception prevails still more stronglyin the case of the children of the brain.”Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley DonQuixote talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at thepertinacity and persistence he displayed in going through thick andthin in quest of his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aimof his desires. There was a renewal of offers of service andcivilities, and then, with the gracious permission of the lady of thecastle, they took their departure, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sanchoon Dapple.p18e.jpg (18K)CHAPTER XIX.IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD, TOGETHERWITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTSp19a.jpg (131K)Full SizeDon Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego’s village,when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and acouple of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. One of thestudents carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of aportmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs ofribbed stockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of newfencing-foils with buttons. The peasants carried divers articles thatshowed they were on their way from some large town where they hadbought them, and were taking them home to their village; and bothstudents and peasants were struck with the same amazement thateverybody felt who saw Don Quixote for the first time, and were dyingto know who this man, so different from ordinary men, could be. DonQuixote saluted them, and after ascertaining that their road was thesame as his, made them an offer of his company, and begged them toslacken their pace, as their young asses travelled faster than hishorse; and then, to gratify them, he told them in a few words who hewas and the calling and profession he followed, which was that of aknight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the world. He informedthem that his own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha, and that he wascalled, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.All this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to thestudents, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote’s pate; forall that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, andone of them said to him, “If you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as itis the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let yourworship come with us; you will see one of the finest and richestweddings that up to this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, orfor many a league round.”Don Quixote asked him if it was some prince’s, that he spoke of it inthis way. “Not at all,” said the student; “it is the wedding of afarmer and a farmer’s daughter, he the richest in all this country, andshe the fairest mortal ever set eyes on. The display with which it isto be attended will be something rare and out of the common, for itwill be celebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who iscalled, _par excellence_, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom iscalled Camacho the rich. She is eighteen, and he twenty-two, and theyare fairly matched, though some knowing ones, who have all thepedigrees in the world by heart, will have it that the family of thefair Quiteria is better than Camacho’s; but no one minds thatnow-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws. At any rate,Camacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadowwith boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hardwork if he tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil. Hehas provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for inhis own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bellsto perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he hasengaged a host. But none of these things, nor of the many others I haveomitted to mention, will do more to make this a memorable wedding thanthe part which I suspect the despairing Basilio will play in it. ThisBasilio is a youth of the same village as Quiteria, and he lived in thehouse next door to that of her parents, of which circumstance Love tookadvantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten loves of Pyramusand Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliest years, and sheresponded to his passion with countless modest proofs of affection, sothat the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were the talkand the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteriamade up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to thehouse, and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, hearranged a match for his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did notapprove of marrying her to Basilio, who had not so large a share of thegifts of fortune as of nature; for if the truth be told ungrudgingly,he is the most agile youth we know, a mighty thrower of the bar, afirst-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he runs like a deer, andleaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if by magic,sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and, aboveall, handles a sword as well as the best.”“For that excellence alone,” said Don Quixote at this, “the youthdeserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevereherself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who wouldtry to prevent it.”“Say that to my wife,” said Sancho, who had until now listened insilence, “for she won’t hear of anything but each one marrying hisequal, holding with the proverb ‘each ewe to her like.’ What I wouldlike is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a fancy tohim already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and goodluck—I meant to say the opposite—on people who would prevent those wholove one another from marrying.”“If all those who love one another were to marry,” said Don Quixote,“it would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry theirchildren to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it wasleft to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be forchoosing her father’s servant, and another, someone she has seenpassing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may bea drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of thejudgment, so much wanted in choosing one’s way of life; and thematrimonial choice is very liable to error, and it needs great cautionand the special favour of heaven to make it a good one. He who has tomake a long journey, will, if he is wise, look out for some trusty andpleasant companion to accompany him before he sets out. Why, then,should not he do the same who has to make the whole journey of lifedown to the final halting-place of death, more especially when thecompanion has to be his companion in bed, at board, and everywhere, asthe wife is to her husband? The companionship of one’s wife is noarticle of merchandise, that, after it has been bought, may bereturned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accidentthat lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put itround your neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe ofDeath does not cut it, there is no untying. I could say a great dealmore on this subject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel toknow if the señor licentiate has anything more to tell about the storyof Basilio.”To this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him,licentiate, replied, “I have nothing whatever to say further, but thatfrom the moment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to bemarried to Camacho the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heardto utter rational word, and he always goes about moody and dejected,talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses.He eats little and sleeps little, and all he eats is fruit, and when hesleeps, if he sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard earth likea brute beast. Sometimes he gazes at the sky, at other times he fixeshis eyes on the earth in such an abstracted way that he might be takenfor a clothed statue, with its drapery stirred by the wind. In short,he shows such signs of a heart crushed by suffering, that all we whoknow him believe that when to-morrow the fair Quiteria says ‘yes,’ itwill be his sentence of death.”“God will guide it better,” said Sancho, “for God who gives the woundgives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are a good manyhours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any moment,the house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sunshining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health whocan’t stir the next day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast ofhaving driven a nail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and betweena woman’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’ I wouldn’t venture to put the point of a pin,for there would not be room for it; if you tell me Quiteria lovesBasilio heart and soul, then I’ll give him a bag of good luck; forlove, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that make copper seemgold, poverty wealth, and bleary eyes pearls.”“What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!” said Don Quixote;“for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together, noone can understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he had thee. Tellme, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anythingelse?”“Oh, if you don’t understand me,” replied Sancho, “it is no wonder mywords are taken for nonsense; but no matter; I understand myself, and Iknow I have not said anything very foolish in what I have said; onlyyour worship, señor, is always gravelling at everything I say, nay,everything I do.”“Cavilling, not gravelling,” said Don Quixote, “thou prevaricator ofhonest language, God confound thee!”“Don’t find fault with me, your worship,” returned Sancho, “for youknow I have not been bred up at court or trained at Salamanca, to knowwhether I am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words. Why! Godbless me, it’s not fair to force a Sayago-man to speak like a Toledan;maybe there are Toledans who do not hit it off when it comes topolished talk.”“That is true,” said the licentiate, “for those who have been bred upin the Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those who arealmost all day pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are allToledans. Pure, correct, elegant and lucid language will be met with inmen of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have beenborn in Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are manywho are not so, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, ifit be accompanied by practice. I, sirs, for my sins have studied canonlaw at Salamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning inclear, plain, and intelligible language.”“If you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those foilsyou carry than on dexterity of tongue,” said the other student, “youwould have been head of the degrees, where you are now tail.”“Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,” returned the licentiate, “you have themost mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword, if youthink it useless.”“It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,” repliedCorchuelo; “and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, youhave swords there, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady handand a strong arm, and these joined with my resolution, which is notsmall, will make you confess that I am not mistaken. Dismount and putin practice your positions and circles and angles and science, for Ihope to make you see stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship,in which, next to God, I place my trust that the man is yet to be bornwho will make me turn my back, and that there is not one in the world Iwill not compel to give ground.”“As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,”replied the master of fence; “though it might be that your grave wouldbe dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; I meanthat you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with thesword.”“We shall soon see,” replied Corchuelo, and getting off his assbriskly, he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carriedon his beast.“It must not be that way,” said Don Quixote at this point; “I will bethe director of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputedquestion;” and dismounting from Rocinante and grasping his lance, heplanted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, withan easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards Corchuelo, whocame on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the saying is. Theother two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from theirasses, served as spectators of the mortal tragedy. The cuts, thrusts,down strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered werepast counting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked like anangry lion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of thelicentiate’s sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset,and made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly asrelics are and ought to be kissed. The end of it was that thelicentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons ofthe short cassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tailsof a cuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired himout, that in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hiltand flung it away with such force, that one of the peasants that werethere, who was a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavitafterwards that he sent it nearly three-quarters of a league, whichtestimony will serve, and has served, to show and establish with allcertainty that strength is overcome by skill.Corchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, “By myfaith, señor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will neverchallenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, foryou have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers asthey call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a swordthrough the eye of a needle.”“I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,” said Corchuelo,“and with having had the truth I was so ignorant of proved to me byexperience;” and getting up he embraced the licentiate, and they werebetter friends than ever; and not caring to wait for the notary who hadgone for the sword, as they saw he would be a long time about it, theyresolved to push on so as to reach the village of Quiteria, to whichthey all belonged, in good time.During the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to themon the excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, andsuch figures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of thevalue of the science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism.It grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all asif there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front ofit. They heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety ofinstruments, flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels,and as they drew near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcadethat had been constructed at the entrance of the town were filled withlights unaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentlethat it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicianswere the life of the wedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds inseparate bands, some dancing, others singing, others playing thevarious instruments already mentioned. In short, it seemed as thoughmirth and gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow.Several other persons were engaged in erecting raised benches fromwhich people might conveniently see the plays and dances that were tobe performed the next day on the spot dedicated to the celebration ofthe marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies of Basilio. DonQuixote would not enter the village, although the peasant as well asthe bachelor pressed him; he excused himself, however, on the grounds,amply sufficient in his opinion, that it was the custom ofknights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to towns,even were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a little out ofthe road, very much against Sancho’s will, as the good quarters he hadenjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back to his mind.p19e.jpg (29K)CHAPTER XX.WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH,TOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POORp20a.jpg (125K)Full SizeScarce had the fair Aurora given bright Phœbus time to dry the liquidpearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, whenDon Quixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet andcalled to his squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which DonQuixote ere he roused him thus addressed him: “Happy thou, above allthe dwellers on the face of the earth, that, without envying or beingenvied, sleepest with tranquil mind, and that neither enchanterspersecute nor enchantments affright. Sleep, I say, and will say ahundred times, without any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to makethee keep ceaseless vigils, or any cares as to how thou art to pay thedebts thou owest, or find to-morrow’s food for thyself and thy needylittle family, to interfere with thy repose. Ambition breaks not thyrest, nor doth this world’s empty pomp disturb thee, for the utmostreach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass, since upon my shouldersthou hast laid the support of thyself, the counterpoise and burden thatnature and custom have imposed upon masters. The servant sleeps and themaster lies awake thinking how he is to feed him, advance him, andreward him. The distress of seeing the sky turn brazen, and withholdits needful moisture from the earth, is not felt by the servant but bythe master, who in time of scarcity and famine must support him who hasserved him in times of plenty and abundance.”p20b.jpg (365K)Full SizeTo all this Sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would hehave wakened up so soon as he did had not Don Quixote brought him tohis senses with the butt of his lance. He awoke at last, drowsy andlazy, and casting his eyes about in every direction, observed, “Therecomes, if I don’t mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam anda smell a great deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; awedding that begins with smells like that, by my faith, ought to beplentiful and unstinting.”“Have done, thou glutton,” said Don Quixote; “come, let us go andwitness this bridal, and see what the rejected Basilio does.”“Let him do what he likes,” returned Sancho; “be he not poor, he wouldmarry Quiteria. To make a grand match for himself, and he without afarthing; is there nothing else? Faith, señor, it’s my opinion the poorman should be content with what he can get, and not go looking fordainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm that Camacho couldbury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is, what afool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels Camachomust have given her and will give her, and take Basilio’s bar-throwingand sword-play. They won’t give a pint of wine at the tavern for a goodcast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. Talents andaccomplishments that can’t be turned into money, let Count Dirlos havethem; but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, I wish mycondition of life was as becoming as they are. On a good foundation youcan raise a good building, and the best foundation in the world ismoney.”“For God’s sake, Sancho,” said Don Quixote here, “stop that harangue;it is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnestevery instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping;for thou wouldst spend it all in talking.”“If your worship had a good memory,” replied Sancho, “you wouldremember the articles of our agreement before we started from home thislast time; one of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, solong as it was not against my neighbour or your worship’s authority;and so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said article.”“I remember no such article, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “and even if itwere so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for theinstruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven thevalleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool ofthe morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.”Sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinanteand the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurelypace entered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself toSancho’s eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in thefire at which it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sizedmountain of faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze hadnot been made in the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were sixhalf wine-jars, each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house;they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insideswithout showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons.Countless were the hares ready skinned and the plucked fowls that hungon the trees for burial in the pots, numberless the wildfowl and gameof various sorts suspended from the branches that the air might keepthem cool. Sancho counted more than sixty wine skins of over sixgallons each, and all filled, as it proved afterwards, with generouswines. There were, besides, piles of the whitest bread, like the heapsof corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There was a wall made ofcheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons full of oil,bigger than those of a dyer’s shop, served for cooking fritters, whichwhen fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and plunged intoanother cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Of cooks andcook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe. In thecapacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs, which,sewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour. The spices ofdifferent kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but bythe quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest. In short, allthe preparations made for the wedding were in rustic style, butabundant enough to feed an army.p20c.jpg (415K)Full SizeSancho observed all, contemplated all, and everything won his heart.The first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots, out of whichhe would have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; thenthe wine skins secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of thefrying-pans, if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be calledfrying-pans; and unable to control himself or bear it any longer, heapproached one of the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily beggedpermission to soak a scrap of bread in one of the pots; to which thecook made answer, “Brother, this is not a day on which hunger is tohave any sway, thanks to the rich Camacho; get down and look about fora ladle and skim off a hen or two, and much good may they do you.”“I don’t see one,” said Sancho.“Wait a bit,” said the cook; “sinner that I am! how particular andbashful you are!” and so saying, he seized a bucket and plunging itinto one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese, andsaid to Sancho, “Fall to, friend, and take the edge off your appetitewith these skimmings until dinner-time comes.”p20d.jpg (351K)Full Size“I have nothing to put them in,” said Sancho.“Well then,” said the cook, “take spoon and all; for Camacho’s wealthand happiness furnish everything.”While Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at oneend of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and galadress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome fieldtrappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who,marshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over themeadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of “Long live Camacho andQuiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!”Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, “It is easy to see thesefolk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they wouldbe more moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.”Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began toenter the arcade at different points, and among them one ofsword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant andhigh-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and withhandkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one ofthose on the mares asked an active youth who led them if any of thedancers had been wounded. “As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,”said he, “we are all safe and sound;” and he at once began to executecomplicated figures with the rest of his comrades, with so many turnsand so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to seedances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good asthis. He also admired another that came in composed of fair youngmaidens, none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteenyears of age, all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided,partly flowing loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with thesunbeams, and over them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses,amaranth, and honeysuckle. At their head were a venerable old man andan ancient dame, more brisk and active, however, than might have beenexpected from their years. The notes of a Zamora bagpipe accompaniedthem, and with modesty in their countenances and in their eyes, andlightness in their feet, they looked the best dancers in the world.p20e.jpg (361K)Full SizeFollowing these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call“speaking dances.” It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, withthe god Cupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnishedwith wings, bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of goldand silk of divers colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore theirnames written on white parchment in large letters on their backs.“Poetry” was the name of the first, “Wit” of the second, “Birth” of thethird, and “Valour” of the fourth. Those that followed Interest weredistinguished in the same way; the badge of the first announced“Liberality,” that of the second “Largess,” the third “Treasure,” andthe fourth “Peaceful Possession.” In front of them all came a woodencastle drawn by four wild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green,and looking so natural that they nearly terrified Sancho. On the frontof the castle and on each of the four sides of its frame it bore theinscription “Castle of Caution.” Four skillful tabor and flute playersaccompanied them, and the dance having been opened, Cupid, afterexecuting two figures, raised his eyes and bent his bow against adamsel who stood between the turrets of the castle, and thus addressedher:I am the mighty God whose swayIs potent over land and sea.The heavens above us own me; nay,The shades below acknowledge me.I know not fear, I have my will,Whate’er my whim or fancy be;For me there’s no impossible,I order, bind, forbid, set free.Having concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of thecastle, and went back to his place. Interest then came forward and wentthrough two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said:But mightier than Love am I,Though Love it be that leads me on,Than mine no lineage is more high,Or older, underneath the sun.To use me rightly few know how,To act without me fewer still,For I am Interest, and I vowFor evermore to do thy will.Interest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she had gonethrough her figures like the others, fixing her eyes on the damsel ofthe castle, she said:With many a fanciful conceit,Fair Lady, winsome PoesyHer soul, an offering at thy feet,Presents in sonnets unto thee.If thou my homage wilt not scorn,Thy fortune, watched by envious eyes,On wings of poesy upborneShall be exalted to the skies.Poetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, andafter having gone through her figures, said:To give, while shunning each extreme,The sparing hand, the over-free,Therein consists, so wise men deem,The virtue Liberality.But thee, fair lady, to enrich,Myself a prodigal I’ll prove,A vice not wholly shameful, whichMay find its fair excuse in love.In the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced andretired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, someof them graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote’s memory (though hehad an excellent one) only carried away those that have been justquoted. All then mingled together, forming chains and breaking offagain with graceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed infront of the castle he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest brokegilded pellets against it. At length, after they had danced a goodwhile, Interest drew out a great purse, made of the skin of a largebrindled cat and to all appearance full of money, and flung it at thecastle, and with the force of the blow the boards fell asunder andtumbled down, leaving the damsel exposed and unprotected. Interest andthe characters of his band advanced, and throwing a great chain of goldover her neck pretended to take her and lead her away captive, onseeing which, Love and his supporters made as though they would releaseher, the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors and inthe form of a regular dance. The wild men made peace between them, andwith great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of the castle, andthe damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with this the dancewound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.Don Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed andarranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who hada nice taste in devising things of the sort. “I will lay a wager,” saidDon Quixote, “that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friendof Camacho’s than of Basilio’s, and that he is better at satire than atvespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and theriches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.” Sancho Panza, who waslistening to all this, exclaimed, “The king is my cock; I stick toCamacho.” “It is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,” said DonQuixote, “and one of that sort that cry ‘Long life to the conqueror.’”“I don’t know of what sort I am,” returned Sancho, “but I know verywell I’ll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio’s pots as theseI have got off Camacho’s;” and he showed him the bucketful of geese andhens, and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite,saying, “A fig for the accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hastso much art thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hastthou. As a grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two familiesin the world, the Haves and the Haven’ts; and she stuck to the Haves;and to this day, Señor Don Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulseof ‘Have,’ than of ‘Know;’ an ass covered with gold looks better than ahorse with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, thebountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares andrabbits; but of Basilio’s, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot,they’ll be only rinsings.”“Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?” said Don Quixote. “Of courseI have finished it,” replied Sancho, “because I see your worship takesoffence at it; but if it was not for that, there was work enough cutout for three days.”“God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,” said Don Quixote.“At the rate we are going,” said Sancho, “I’ll be chewing clay beforeyour worship dies; and then, maybe, I’ll be so dumb that I’ll not say aword until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day ofjudgment.”“Even should that happen, O Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thy silencewill never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talkall thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my deathwill come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not evenwhen thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.”“In good faith, señor,” replied Sancho, “there’s no trusting thatfleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep,and, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot upon thelofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That lady is moremighty than dainty, she is in no way squeamish, she devours all and isready for all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages,and ranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all timesshe is reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green;she never seems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put beforeher, for she has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and thoughshe has no belly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drinkthe lives of all that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.”“Say no more, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this; “don’t try to betterit, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death inthy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tell thee,Sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightsttake a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons.”“He preaches well who lives well,” said Sancho, “and I know no moretheology than that.”“Nor needst thou,” said Don Quixote, “but I cannot conceive or make outhow it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of wisdom, thou,who art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so much.”“Pass judgment on your chivalries, señor,” returned Sancho, “and don’tset yourself up to judge of other men’s fears or braveries, for I am asgood a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch theseskimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be calledto account for in the other world;” and so saying, he began a freshattack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he aroused DonQuixote’s, who no doubt would have helped him had he not been preventedby what must be told farther on.p20f.jpg (41K)CHAPTER XXI.IN WHICH CAMACHO’S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFULINCIDENTSp21a.jpg (118K)Full SizeWhile Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forththe last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which wereuttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop,shouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approachingwith musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, andaccompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the mostdistinguished people of the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw thebride, he exclaimed, “By my faith, she is not dressed like a countrygirl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out,the patena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff isthirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen trimming—by my oath, butit’s satin! Look at her hands—jet rings on them! May I never have luckif they’re not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as whiteas a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one’s head!Whoreson baggage, what hair she has! if it’s not a wig, I never sawlonger or fairer all the days of my life. See how bravely she bearsherself—and her shape! Wouldn’t you say she was like a walking palmtree loaded with clusters of dates? for the trinkets she has hangingfrom her hair and neck look just like them. I swear in my heart she isa brave lass, and fit ‘to pass over the banks of Flanders.’”Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s boorish eulogies and thought that,saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautifulwoman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt,because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out fortheir wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stoodon one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where theywere to plight their troth, and from which they were to behold thedances and plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot theyheard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, “Wait alittle, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!” At these words allturned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in whatseemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches likeflames. He was crowned (as was presently seen) with a crown of gloomycypress, and in his hand he held a long staff. As he approached he wasrecognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously tosee what would come of his words, in dread of some catastrophe inconsequence of his appearance at such a moment. He came up at lastweary and breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair,drove his staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground,and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he thus addressed herin a hoarse, trembling voice:“Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holylaw we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor artthou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertionswould improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respectdue to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to mytrue love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealthserves to bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; andnow to complete it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch asheaven is pleased to bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, doaway with the obstacle that may interfere with it, and remove myselffrom between you. Long live the rich Camacho! many a happy year may helive with the ungrateful Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die,Basilio whose poverty clipped the wings of his happiness, and broughthim to the grave!”And so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, andleaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath thatconcealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hiltbeing planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threwhimself upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steelblade appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathedin his blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.His friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery andsad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened tosupport him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceasedto breathe. They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest whowas standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessedhim, as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death.Basilio, however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though inpain, “If thou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand asmy bride in this last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashnesswould find pardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of beingthine.”Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soulrather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness imploreGod’s pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilioreplied that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria firstgave him her hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose hismind and give him courage to make his confession.Don Quixote hearing the wounded man’s entreaty, exclaimed aloud thatwhat Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request thatmight be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to SeñorCamacho’s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the braveBasilio as if he received her direct from her father.“In this case,” said he, “it will be only to say ‘yes,’ and noconsequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptialcouch of this marriage must be the grave.”Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and notknowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties ofBasilio’s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him herhand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not belost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria werewilling to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off thefulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteriaand pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and otherswith persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she,harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable orunwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had notthe priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio nowhad his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.p21b.jpg (374K)Full SizeOn this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, andrepentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyesalready turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuringthe name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to dielike a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, andkneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio openedhis eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, “O Quiteria, why hast thouturned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as adagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left eitherto bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or tosuppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of deathover my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is thatthe hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out ofcomplaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declarethat without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as tothy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle withme at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with onewho has dealt so truly by thee.”While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystandersexpected each return of faintness would take his life with it. ThenQuiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right handthe hand of Basilio, said, “No force would bend my will; as freely,therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of alawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own freewill, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act hasbrought upon thee.”“Yes, I give it,” said Basilio, “not agitated or distracted, but withunclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I givemyself to be thy husband.”“And I give myself to be thy wife,” said Quiteria, “whether thou livestmany years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.”“For one so badly wounded,” observed Sancho at this point, “this youngman has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing andcooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more onhis tongue than at his teeth.”Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply movedand with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, andimplored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newlywedded man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimblyto his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier thathad been sheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, andsome, more simple than inquiring, began shouting, “A miracle, amiracle!” But Basilio replied, “No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, atrick!” The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine thewound with both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not throughBasilio’s flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood,which he had adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwardsascertained, having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, thepriest and Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked andmade fools of. The bride showed no signs of displeasure at thedeception; on the contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, beingfraudulent, would not be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh,whence they all concluded that the affair had been planned by agreementand understanding between the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporterswere so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves byviolence, and a great number of them drawing their swords attackedBasilio, in whose protection as many more swords were in an instantunsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on horseback, with hislance over his arm and well covered with his shield, made all give waybefore him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in suchdoings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he had taken hisdelectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that spotwould be respected.“Hold, sirs, hold!” cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; “we have noright to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: rememberlove and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable andcommon to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so inthe contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed toattain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to thediscredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged toBasilio and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal ofheaven. Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, andas it pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, howeverpowerful he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hathjoined man cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass thepoint of this lance;” and so saying he brandished it so stoutly anddexterously that he overawed all who did not know him.But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made onCamacho’s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and sothe counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man,prevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans werepacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again,inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftinessof Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had sucha love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman,and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than forhaving given her.Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled andpacified, those on Basilio’s side were appeased; and the rich Camacho,to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not careabout it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married inreality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followerswould take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio’s village; forthe poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those whofollow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those whoflatter and dance attendance on them. With them they carried DonQuixote, regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alonehad a cloud on his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting forCamacho’s splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; andthus dragged away, he moodily followed his master, who accompaniedBasilio’s party, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though inhis heart he took them with him, and their now nearly finishedskimmings that he carried in the bucket conjured up visions before hiseyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer he was losing. Andso, vexed and dejected though not hungry, without dismounting fromDapple he followed in the footsteps of Rocinante.p21c.jpg (417K)Full Sizep21e.jpg (49K)CHAPTER XXII.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS IN THEHEART OF LA MANCHA, WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE BROUGHT TO A HAPPYTERMINATIONp22a.jpg (112K)Full SizeMany and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newlymarried couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him forcoming forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdomto the same level with his courage, rating him as a Cid in arms, and aCicero in eloquence. Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days atthe expense of the pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound wasnot a scheme arranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device ofBasilio’s, who counted on exactly the result they had seen; heconfessed, it is true, that he had confided his idea to some of hisfriends, so that at the proper time they might aid him in his purposeand insure the success of the deception.p22b.jpg (344K)Full Size“That,” said Don Quixote, “is not and ought not to be called deceptionwhich aims at virtuous ends;” and the marriage of lovers he maintainedto be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has nogreater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety,enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in thepossession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are thedeclared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Señor Basilio toabandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, forthough they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and applyhimself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which willnever fail those who are prudent and persevering. The poor man who is aman of honour (if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour) has a jewelwhen he has a fair wife, and if she is taken from him, his honour istaken from him and slain. The fair woman who is a woman of honour, andwhose husband is poor, deserves to be crowned with the laurels andcrowns of victory and triumph. Beauty by itself attracts the desires ofall who behold it, and the royal eagles and birds of towering flightstoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if beauty be accompanied by wantand penury, then the ravens and the kites and other birds of preyassail it, and she who stands firm against such attacks well deservesto be called the crown of her husband. “Remember, O prudent Basilio,”added Don Quixote, “it was the opinion of a certain sage, I know notwhom, that there was not more than one good woman in the whole world;and his advice was that each one should think and believe that this onegood woman was his own wife, and in this way he would live happy. Imyself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever entered my thoughts tobe so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice to anyone who mightask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as he wouldbe content to marry. The first thing I would recommend him, would be tolook to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman does not wina good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seen that she isso, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a woman’shonour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman into your houseit will be an easy matter to keep her good, and even to make her stillbetter; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mendher, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to another.I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.”Sancho, listening to all this, said to himself, “This master of mine,when I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take apulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but Isay of him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and givingadvice not only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger,and go into the market-places to his heart’s content. Devil take youfor a knight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think inmy heart that the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry;but there is nothing he won’t have a finger in.”Sancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, andasked, “What art thou muttering there, Sancho?”“I’m not saying anything or muttering anything,” said Sancho; “I wasonly saying to myself that I wish I had heard what your worship hassaid just now before I married; perhaps I’d say now, ‘The ox that’sloose licks himself well.’”“Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?”“She is not very bad,” replied Sancho; “but she is not very good; atleast she is not as good as I could wish.”“Thou dost wrong, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “to speak ill of thy wife;for after all she is the mother of thy children.” “We are quits,”returned Sancho; “for she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it intoher head, especially when she is jealous; and Satan himself could notput up with her then.”In fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, bywhom they were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote beggedthe fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to thecave of Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see withhis own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over thecountry were true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of hisown, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books ofchivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouthof the very cave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which werelikewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and heassured him he would find him entertaining, for he was a youth whocould write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes.The cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddlecovered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddledRocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with whichwent those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commendingthemselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking theroad for the famous cave of Montesinos.On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character hispursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he wasby profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were makingbooks for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment tothe nation. One was called “The Book of Liveries,” in which hedescribed seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours,mottoes, and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick andchoose any they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to goa-begging for them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the sayingis, to have them appropriate to their objects and purposes; “for,” saidhe, “I give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, whatwill suit them, and fit them without fail. I have another book, too,which I shall call ‘Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,’ one of rareand original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I showin it who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were,what the sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls ofGuisando, the Sierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains atMadrid, not forgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and ofthe Priora; and all with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, sothat they are amusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once.Another book I have which I call ‘The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,’which treats of the invention of things, and is a work of greaterudition and research, for I establish and elucidate elegantly somethings of great importance which Polydore omitted to mention. He forgotto tell us who was the first man in the world that had a cold in hishead, and who was the first to try salivation for the French disease,but I give it accurately set forth, and quote more than five-and-twentyauthors in proof of it, so you may perceive I have laboured to goodpurpose and that the book will be of service to the whole world.”Sancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin’s words, said to him,“Tell me, señor—and God give you luck in printing your books—can youtell me (for of course you know, as you know everything) who was thefirst man that scratched his head? For to my thinking it must have beenour father Adam.”“So it must,” replied the cousin; “for there is no doubt but Adam had ahead and hair; and being the first man in the world he would havescratched himself sometimes.”“So I think,” said Sancho; “but now tell me, who was the first tumblerin the world?”“Really, brother,” answered the cousin, “I could not at this moment saypositively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I goback to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time wemeet, for this will not be the last time.”“Look here, señor,” said Sancho, “don’t give yourself any trouble aboutit, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you. The firsttumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast orpitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomlesspit.”“You are right, friend,” said the cousin; and said Don Quixote,“Sancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heardthem from someone else.”“Hold your peace, señor,” said Sancho; “faith, if I take to askingquestions and answering, I’ll go on from this till to-morrow morning.Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn’t go looking forhelp from my neighbours.”“Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote;“for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and provingthings that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthingto the understanding or memory.”In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that nightthey put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leaguesto the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, thatif he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him toprovide himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered intoits depths. Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomlesspit he meant to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundredfathoms of rope, and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived atthe cave, the mouth of which is spacious and wide, but full of thornand wild-fig bushes and brambles and briars, so thick and matted thatthey completely close it up and cover it over.On coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixotedismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmlywith the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho saidto him, “Mind what you are about, master mine; don’t go buryingyourself alive, or putting yourself where you’ll be like a bottle putto cool in a well; it’s no affair or business of your worship’s tobecome the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorishdungeon.”“Tie me and hold thy peace,” said Don Quixote, “for an emprise likethis, friend Sancho, was reserved for me;” and said the guide, “I begof you, Señor Don Quixote, to observe carefully and examine with ahundred eyes everything that is within there; perhaps there may be somethings for me to put into my book of ‘Transformations.’”“The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,” saidSancho Panza.When he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over thearmour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, “It wascareless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bellto be tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show thatI was still descending and alive; but as that is out of the questionnow, in God’s hand be it to guide me;” and forthwith he fell on hisknees and in a low voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring Godto aid him and grant him success in this to all appearance perilous anduntried adventure, and then exclaimed aloud, “O mistress of my actionsand movements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so bethe prayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thyears, by thy incomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, forthey but ask thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that Istand in such need of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, toplunge myself into the abyss that is here before me, only to let theworld know that while thou dost favour me there is no impossibility Iwill not attempt and accomplish.” With these words he approached thecavern, and perceived that it was impossible to let himself down oreffect an entrance except by sheer force or cleaving a passage; sodrawing his sword he began to demolish and cut away the brambles at themouth of the cave, at the noise of which a vast multitude of crows andchoughs flew out of it so thick and so fast that they knocked DonQuixote down; and if he had been as much of a believer in augury as hewas a Catholic Christian he would have taken it as a bad omen anddeclined to bury himself in such a place. He got up, however, and asthere came no more crows, or night-birds like the bats that flew out atthe same time with the crows, the cousin and Sancho giving him rope, helowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern; and as he enteredit Sancho sent his blessing after him, making a thousand crosses overhim and saying, “God, and the Peña de Francia, and the Trinity of Gaetaguide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant. There thou goest, thoudare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of brass; once more, Godguide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and unhurt to the light ofthis world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the darkness thou artseeking there;” and the cousin offered up almost the same prayers andsupplications.p22c.jpg (365K)Full SizeDon Quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, andthey gave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, whichcame out of the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had letdown the hundred fathoms of rope. They were inclined to pull DonQuixote up again, as they could give him no more rope; however, theywaited about half an hour, at the end of which time they began togather in the rope again with great ease and without feeling anyweight, which made them fancy Don Quixote was remaining below; andpersuaded that it was so, Sancho wept bitterly, and hauled away ingreat haste in order to settle the question. When, however, they hadcome to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty fathoms they felt aweight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at last, at tenfathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sancho called out tohim, saying, “Welcome back, señor, for we had begun to think you weregoing to stop there to found a family.” But Don Quixote answered not aword, and drawing him out entirely they perceived he had his eyes shutand every appearance of being fast asleep.They stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did notawake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulledhim about, so that after some time he came to himself, stretchinghimself just as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, andlooking about him he said, “God forgive you, friends; ye have taken meaway from the sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle thatever human being enjoyed or beheld. Now indeed do I know that all thepleasures of this life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fadelike the flower of the field. O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-woundedDurandarte! O unhappy Belerma! O tearful Guadiana, and ye O haplessdaughters of Ruidera who show in your waves the tears that flowed fromyour beauteous eyes!”p22d.jpg (318K)Full SizeThe cousin and Sancho Panza listened with deep attention to the wordsof Don Quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drewthem up from his very bowels. They begged of him to explain himself,and tell them what he had seen in that hell down there.“Hell do you call it?” said Don Quixote; “call it by no such name, forit does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.”He then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was veryhungry. They spread the cousin’s sackcloth on the grass, and put thestores of the alforjas into requisition, and all three sitting downlovingly and sociably, they made a luncheon and a supper of it all inone; and when the sackcloth was removed, Don Quixote of La Mancha said,“Let no one rise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.”p22e.jpg (48K)CHAPTER XXIII.OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THE INCOMPARABLE DON QUIXOTE SAID HE SAW IN THEPROFOUND CAVE OF MONTESINOS, THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND MAGNITUDE OF WHICHCAUSE THIS ADVENTURE TO BE DEEMED APOCRYPHALp23a.jpg (148K)Full SizeIt was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, withsubdued light and tempered beams, enabled Don Quixote to relate,without heat or inconvenience, what he had seen in the cave ofMontesinos to his two illustrious hearers, and he began as follows:“A matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man’s height down in thispit, on the right-hand side, there is a recess or space, roomy enoughto contain a large cart with its mules. A little light reaches itthrough some chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to thesurface of the earth. This recess or space I perceived when I wasalready growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspendedby the rope, travelling downwards into that dark region without anycertainty or knowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter itand rest myself for a while. I called out, telling you not to let outmore rope until I bade you, but you cannot have heard me. I thengathered in the rope you were sending me, and making a coil or pile ofit I seated myself upon it, ruminating and considering what I was to doto lower myself to the bottom, having no one to hold me up; and as Iwas thus deep in thought and perplexity, suddenly and withoutprovocation a profound sleep fell upon me, and when I least expectedit, I know not how, I awoke and found myself in the midst of the mostbeautiful, delightful meadow that nature could produce or the mostlively human imagination conceive. I opened my eyes, I rubbed them, andfound I was not asleep but thoroughly awake. Nevertheless, I felt myhead and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I myself who was thereor some empty delusive phantom; but touch, feeling, the collectedthoughts that passed through my mind, all convinced me that I was thesame then and there that I am this moment. Next there presented itselfto my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls that seemedbuilt of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doors thatopened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me avenerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge thattrailed upon the ground. On his shoulders and breast he had a greensatin collegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet,and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle. He carried no armswhatever, nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sizedfilberts, each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg; hisbearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me spellboundand wondering. He approached me, and the first thing he did was toembrace me closely, and then he said to me, ‘For a long time now, Ovaliant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, we who are here enchanted inthese solitudes have been hoping to see thee, that thou mayest makeknown to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave,called the cave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, an achievementreserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone toattempt. Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee themarvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaideand perpetual warden; for I am Montesinos himself, from whom the cavetakes its name.’“The instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the storythey told in the world above here was true, that he had taken out theheart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a littledagger, and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at thepoint of death had commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke thetruth in every respect except as to the dagger, for it was not adagger, nor little, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.”“That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,”said Sancho.“I do not know,” said Don Quixote; “it could not have been by thatponiard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man of yesterday,and the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was longago; but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect ormake any alteration in the truth or substance of the story.”“That is true,” said the cousin; “continue, Señor Don Quixote, for I amlistening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world.”“And with no less do I tell the tale,” said Don Quixote; “and so, toproceed—the venerable Montesinos led me into the palace of crystal,where, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely of alabaster,was an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld, stretchedat full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper, as areseen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand(which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strengthin its owner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put anyquestion to Montesinos, he, seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement,said to me, ‘This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of thetrue lovers and valiant knights of his time. He is held enchanted here,as I myself and many others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who,they say, was the devil’s son; but my belief is, not that he was thedevil’s son, but that he knew, as the saying is, a point more than thedevil. How or why he enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell,and I suspect that time is not far off. What I marvel at is, that Iknow it to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended hislife in my arms, and that, after his death, I took out his heart withmy own hands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds,for, according to naturalists, he who has a large heart is more largelyendowed with valour than he who has a small one. Then, as this is thecase, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moansand sighs from time to time, as if he were still alive?’p23b.jpg (243K)Full Size“As he said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice:O cousin Montesinos!’Twas my last request of thee,When my soul hath left the body,And that lying dead I be,With thy poniard or thy daggerCut the heart from out my breast,And bear it to Belerma.This was my last request.”“On hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his knees beforethe unhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, ‘Long since, SeñorDurandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bade meon that sad day when I lost you; I took out your heart as well as Icould, not leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lacehandkerchief, and I took the road to France with it, having first laidyou in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse myhands of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels;and more by token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came toafter leaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heartto keep it sweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, intothe presence of the lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself,Guadiana your squire, the duenna Ruidera and her seven daughters andtwo nieces, and many more of your friends and acquaintances, the sageMerlin has been keeping enchanted here these many years; and althoughmore than five hundred have gone by, not one of us has died; Ruideraand her daughters and nieces alone are missing, and these, because ofthe tears they shed, Merlin, out of the compassion he seems to havefelt for them, changed into so many lakes, which to this day in theworld of the living, and in the province of La Mancha, are called theLakes of Ruidera. The seven daughters belong to the kings of Spain andthe two nieces to the knights of a very holy order called the Order ofSt. John. Guadiana your squire, likewise bewailing your fate, waschanged into a river of his own name, but when he came to the surfaceand beheld the sun of another heaven, so great was his grief at findinghe was leaving you, that he plunged into the bowels of the earth;however, as he cannot help following his natural course, he from timeto time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and the world. Thelakes aforesaid send him their waters, and with these, and others thatcome to him, he makes a grand and imposing entrance into Portugal; butfor all that, go where he may, he shows his melancholy and sadness, andtakes no pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse andtasteless sorts, very different from those of the golden Tagus. Allthis that I tell you now, O cousin mine, I have told you many timesbefore, and as you make no answer, I fear that either you believe menot, or do not hear me, whereat I feel God knows what grief. I have nownews to give you, which, if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings,will not in any wise increase them. Know that you have here before you(open your eyes and you will see) that great knight of whom the sageMerlin has prophesied such great things; that Don Quixote of La ManchaI mean, who has again, and to better purpose than in past times,revived in these days knight-errantry, long since forgotten, and bywhose intervention and aid it may be we shall be disenchanted; forgreat deeds are reserved for great men.’“‘And if that may not be,’ said the wretched Durandarte in a low andfeeble voice, ‘if that may not be, then, my cousin, I say “patience andshuffle;”’ and turning over on his side, he relapsed into his formersilence without uttering another word.p23c.jpg (331K)Full Size“And now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompanied bydeep sighs and bitter sobs. I looked round, and through the crystalwall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines offair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkishfashion on their heads. Behind, in the rear of these, there came alady, for so from her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black,with a white veil so long and ample that it swept the ground. Herturban was twice as large as the largest of any of the others; hereyebrows met, her nose was rather flat, her mouth was large but withruddy lips, and her teeth, of which at times she allowed a glimpse,were seen to be sparse and ill-set, though as white as peeled almonds.She carried in her hands a fine cloth, and in it, as well as I couldmake out, a heart that had been mummied, so parched and dried was it.Montesinos told me that all those forming the procession were theattendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who were enchanted there withtheir master and mistress, and that the last, she who carried the heartin the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with her damsels, four days inthe week went in procession singing, or rather weeping, dirges over thebody and miserable heart of his cousin; and that if she appeared to mesomewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as fame reported her, it wasbecause of the bad nights and worse days that she passed in thatenchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles round her eyes,and her sickly complexion; ‘her sallowness, and the rings round hereyes,’ said he, ‘are not caused by the periodical ailment usual withwomen, for it is many months and even years since she has had any, butby the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds inher hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her memorythe sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would thegreat Dulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and evenin the world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.’“‘Hold hard!’ said I at this, ‘tell your story as you ought, Señor DonMontesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, andthere is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerlessDulcinea del Toboso is what she is, and the lady Doña Belerma is what_she_ is and has been, and that’s enough.’ To which he made answer,‘Forgive me, Señor Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spoke unadvisedlyin saying that the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the ladyBelerma; for it were enough for me to have learned, by what means Iknow not, that you are her knight, to make me bite my tongue out beforeI compared her to anything save heaven itself.’ After this apologywhich the great Montesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from theshock I had received in hearing my lady compared with Belerma.”“Still I wonder,” said Sancho, “that your worship did not get upon theold fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks, and pluck his bearduntil you didn’t leave a hair in it.”“Nay, Sancho, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “it would not have beenright in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect to theaged, even though they be not knights, but especially to those who are,and who are enchanted; I only know I gave him as good as he brought inthe many other questions and answers we exchanged.”“I cannot understand, Señor Don Quixote,” remarked the cousin here,“how it is that your worship, in such a short space of time as you havebeen below there, could have seen so many things, and said and answeredso much.”“How long is it since I went down?” asked Don Quixote.“Little better than an hour,” replied Sancho.“That cannot be,” returned Don Quixote, “because night overtook mewhile I was there, and day came, and it was night again and day againthree times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in thoseremote regions beyond our ken.”“My master must be right,” replied Sancho; “for as everything that hashappened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour wouldseem three days and nights there.”“That’s it,” said Don Quixote.“And did your worship eat anything all that time, señor?” asked thecousin.“I never touched a morsel,” answered Don Quixote, “nor did I feelhunger, or think of it.”“And do the enchanted eat?” said the cousin.“They neither eat,” said Don Quixote; “nor are they subject to thegreater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, andhair grow.”“And do the enchanted sleep, now, señor?” asked Sancho.“Certainly not,” replied Don Quixote; “at least, during those threedays I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.”“The proverb, ‘Tell me what company thou keepest and I’ll tell theewhat thou art,’ is to the point here,” said Sancho; “your worship keepscompany with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching;what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you arewith them? But forgive me, señor, if I say that of all this you havetold us now, may God take me—I was just going to say the devil—if Ibelieve a single particle.”“What!” said the cousin, “has Señor Don Quixote, then, been lying? Why,even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put togethersuch a host of lies.”“I don’t believe my master lies,” said Sancho.“If not, what dost thou believe?” asked Don Quixote.“I believe,” replied Sancho, “that this Merlin, or those enchanters whoenchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed withdown there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all thisrigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still to come.”“All that might be, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “but it is not so,for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touchedwith my own hands. But what will you say when I tell you now how, amongthe countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which atleisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in thecourse of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), heshowed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goatsover the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knewone to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two thosesame country girls that were with her and that we spoke to on the roadfrom El Toboso! I asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me hedid not, but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies ofdistinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made theirappearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that,because there were a great many other ladies there of times past andpresent, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he hadrecognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quintañona, she who poured outthe wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain.”When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leaveof his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truthabout the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself hadbeen the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up hismind at last that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits andstark mad, so he said to him, “It was an evil hour, a worse season, anda sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to theother world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Señor Montesinos,who has sent you back to us like this. You were well enough here abovein your full senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims andgiving advice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking thegreatest nonsense that can be imagined.”“As I know thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “I heed not thy words.”“Nor I your worship’s,” said Sancho, “whether you beat me or kill mefor those I have spoken, and will speak if you don’t correct and mendyour own. But tell me, while we are still at peace, how or by what didyou recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to her, what didyou say, and what did she answer?”“I recognised her,” said Don Quixote, “by her wearing the same garmentsshe wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke to her, but shedid not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turned her back onme and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not haveovertaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so had notMontesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would beuseless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would benecessary for me to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that incourse of time he would let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte,and all who were there, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw andobserved down there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinoswas speaking to me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcineaapproached me on one without my having seen her coming, and with tearsin her eyes said to me, in a low, agitated voice, ‘My lady Dulcinea delToboso kisses your worship’s hands, and entreats you to do her thefavour of letting her know how you are; and, being in great need, shealso entreats your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as tolend her half a dozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, onthis new dimity petticoat that I have here; and she promises to repaythem very speedily.’ I was amazed and taken aback by such a message,and turning to Señor Montesinos I asked him, ‘Is it possible, SeñorMontesinos, that persons of distinction under enchantment can be inneed?’ To which he replied, ‘Believe me, Señor Don Quixote, that whichis called need is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates allquarters and reaches everyone, and does not spare even the enchanted;and as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso sends to beg those six reals, andthe pledge is to all appearance a good one, there is nothing for it butto give them to her, for no doubt she must be in some great strait.’ ‘Iwill take no pledge of her,’ I replied, ‘nor yet can I give her whatshe asks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave (they were thosewhich thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon thepoor I met along the road), and I said, ‘Tell your mistress, my dear,that I am grieved to the heart because of her distresses, and wish Iwas a Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have her know that Icannot be, and ought not be, in health while deprived of the happinessof seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation, and that Iimplore her as earnestly as I can, to allow herself to be seen andaddressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight. Tell her,too, that when she least expects it she will hear it announced that Ihave made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquisof Mantua made to avenge his nephew Baldwin, when he found him at thepoint of death in the heart of the mountains, which was, not to eatbread off a tablecloth, and other trifling matters which he added,until he had avenged him; and I will make the same to take no rest, andto roam the seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the InfanteDon Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them, until I have disenchanted her.’‘All that and more, you owe my lady,’ the damsel’s answer to me, andtaking the four reals, instead of making me a curtsey she cut a caper,springing two full yards into the air.”“O blessed God!” exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, “is it possible thatsuch things can be in the world, and that enchanters and enchantmentscan have such power in it as to have changed my master’s right sensesinto a craze so full of absurdity! O señor, señor, for God’s sake,consider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit tothis silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.”“Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,” said DonQuixote; “and not being experienced in the things of the world,everything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible;but time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee some of thethings I saw down there which will make thee believe what I haverelated now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.”p23e.jpg (54K)CHAPTER XXIV.WHEREIN ARE RELATED A THOUSAND TRIFLING MATTERS, AS TRIVIAL AS THEY ARENECESSARY TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT HISTORYp24a.jpg (137K)Full SizeHe who translated this great history from the original written by itsfirst author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chaptergiving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on themargin of it, in Hamete’s own hand, these exact words:“I cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is writtenin the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiantDon Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that haveoccurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but as forthis one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as itpasses all reasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote couldlie, he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of histime, is impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shotto death with arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related andtold the story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he couldnot in so short a space have fabricated such a vast complication ofabsurdities; if, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no faultof mine; and so, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I writeit down. Decide for thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound,nor is it in my power, to do more; though certain it is they say thatat the time of his death he retracted, and said he had invented it,thinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he had read of inhis histories.” And then he goes on to say:The cousin was amazed as well at Sancho’s boldness as at the patienceof his master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayedarose from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady Dulcinea, evenenchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and language Sanchohad addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he seemed to himto have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now observed,“I, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I have spent intravelling with your worship as very well employed, for I have gainedfour things in the course of it; the first is that I have made youracquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that Ihave learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with thetransformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will beof use to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, tohave discovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at leastin the time of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you sayDurandarte uttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinoswas talking to him, he woke up and said, ‘Patience and shuffle.’ Thisphrase and expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted,but only before he had become so, in France, and in the time of theaforesaid emperor Charlemagne. And this demonstration is just the thingfor me for that other book I am writing, the ‘Supplement to PolydoreVergil on the Invention of Antiquities;’ for I believe he never thoughtof inserting that of cards in his book, as I mean to do in mine, and itwill be a matter of great importance, particularly when I can cite sograve and veracious an authority as Señor Durandarte. And the fourththing is, that I have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana,heretofore unknown to mankind.”“You are right,” said Don Quixote; “but I should like to know, if byGod’s favour they grant you a licence to print those books ofyours—which I doubt—to whom do you mean to dedicate them?”“There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be dedicated,”said the cousin.“Not many,” said Don Quixote; “not that they are unworthy of it, butbecause they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation ofmaking the return that seems due to the author’s labour and courtesy.One prince I know who makes up for all the rest, and more—how muchmore, if I ventured to say, perhaps I should stir up envy in many anoble breast; but let this stand over for some more convenient time,and let us go and look for some place to shelter ourselves into-night.”“Not far from this,” said the cousin, “there is a hermitage, wherethere lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who has thereputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent andcharitable man. Close to the hermitage he has a small house which hebuilt at his own cost, but though small it is large enough for thereception of guests.”“Has this hermit any hens, do you think?” asked Sancho.“Few hermits are without them,” said Don Quixote; “for those we seenow-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian deserts who wereclad in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. But do notthink that by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I mean tosay is that the penances of those of the present day do not come up tothe asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not followfrom this that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; andat the worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm thanthe open sinner.”At this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man onfoot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lancesand halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed onwithout stopping. Don Quixote called to him, “Stay, good fellow; youseem to be making more haste than suits that mule.”“I cannot stop, señor,” answered the man; “for the arms you see I carryhere are to be used to-morrow, so I must not delay; God be with you.But if you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean to lodgeto-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be goingthe same road you will find me there, and I will tell you some curiousthings; once more God be with you;” and he urged on his mule at such apace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him what these curious thingswere that he meant to tell them; and as he was somewhat inquisitive,and always tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he decidedto set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead ofstopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.Accordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for theinn, which they reached a little before nightfall. On the road thecousin proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. Theinstant Sancho heard this he steered his Dapple towards it, and DonQuixote and the cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho’s bad luck soordered it that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit theyfound in the hermitage told them. They called for some of the best. Shereplied that her master had none, but that if they liked cheap watershe would give it with great pleasure.“If I found any in water,” said Sancho, “there are wells along the roadwhere I could have had enough of it. Ah, Camacho’s wedding, andplentiful house of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!”Leaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a littlefarther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them atno great speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over hisshoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently,probably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two;for he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it inplaces, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and hisshoes square-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have beeneighteen or nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to allappearance of an active habit, and he went along singing seguidillas tobeguile the wearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he wasjust finishing one, which the cousin got by heart and they say ranthus—I’m off to the warsFor the want of pence,Oh, had I but moneyI’d show more sense.The first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, “You travel veryairily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasureto tell us?”To which the youth replied, “The heat and my poverty are the reason ofmy travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.”“How poverty?” asked Don Quixote; “the heat one can understand.”“Señor,” replied the youth, “in this bundle I carry velvet pantaloonsto match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I shall not beable to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and I have notthe wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as tokeep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake somecompanies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shallenlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel withafter that to the place of embarkation, which they say will beCarthagena; I would rather have the King for a master, and serve him inthe wars, than serve a court pauper.”“And did you get any bounty, now?” asked the cousin.“If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage ofdistinction,” replied the youth, “I should have been safe to get it;for that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of theservants’ hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a goodpension. But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters andadventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty thathalf went in paying for the starching of one’s collars; it would be amiracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonablebounty.”“And tell me, for heaven’s sake,” asked Don Quixote, “is it possible,my friend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?”“They gave me two,” replied the page; “but just as when one quits areligious community before making profession, they strip him of thedress of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my mastersreturn me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to courtwas finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had givenmerely for show.”“What spilorceria!—as an Italian would say,” said Don Quixote; “but forall that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthyan object as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable orprofitable than serving, first of all God, and then one’s king andnatural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if notmore wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as Ihave said many a time; for though letters may have founded more greathouses than arms, still those founded by arms have I know not whatsuperiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendourbelonging to them that distinguishes them above all. And bear in mindwhat I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use andcomfort to you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell onthe adverse chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death,and if it be a good death, the best of all is to die. They asked JuliusCæsar, the valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered,that which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; andthough he answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of thetrue God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he wasright; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish,whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it? It isonly dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier showsbetter dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the goodsoldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains andthose in command over him. And remember, my son, that it is better forthe soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that if old ageshould come upon you in this honourable calling, though you may becovered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon youwithout honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially nowthat provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old anddisabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after thefashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves whenthey are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses underthe pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, fromwhich they cannot expect to be released except by death. But for thepresent I won’t say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far asthe inn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue yourjourney, and God give you as good speed as your intentions deserve.”The page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he did that tosupper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, “God bewith you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things somany and so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw theimpossible absurdities he reports about the cave of Montesinos? Well,well, we shall see.”And now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it wasnot without satisfaction that Sancho perceived his master took it for areal inn, and not for a castle as usual. The instant they entered DonQuixote asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds,and was told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which waswhat Sancho and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving thebest manger and the best place in the stable to Rocinante.p24e.jpg (61K)CHAPTER XXV.WHEREIN IS SET DOWN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, AND THE DROLL ONE OF THEPUPPET-SHOWMAN, TOGETHER WITH THE MEMORABLE DIVINATIONS OF THE DIVININGAPEp25a.jpg (154K)Full SizeDon Quixote’s bread would not bake, as the common saying is, until hehad heard and learned the curious things promised by the man whocarried the arms. He went to seek him where the innkeeper said he wasand having found him, bade him say now at any rate what he had to sayin answer to the question he had asked him on the road. “The tale of mywonders must be taken more leisurely and not standing,” said the man;“let me finish foddering my beast, good sir; and then I’ll tell youthings that will astonish you.”“Don’t wait for that,” said Don Quixote; “I’ll help you in everything,”and so he did, sifting the barley for him and cleaning out the manger;a degree of humility which made the other feel bound to tell him with agood grace what he had asked; so seating himself on a bench, with DonQuixote beside him, and the cousin, the page, Sancho Panza, and thelandlord, for a senate and an audience, he began his story in this way:“You must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn,it so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery of aservant girl of his (it’s too long a tale to tell), lost an ass; andthough he did all he possibly could to find it, it was all to nopurpose. A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since theass had been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standingin the plaza, another regidor of the same town said to him, ‘Pay me forgood news, gossip; your ass has turned up.’ ‘That I will, and well,gossip,’ said the other; ‘but tell us, where has he turned up?’ ‘In theforest,’ said the finder; ‘I saw him this morning without pack-saddleor harness of any sort, and so lean that it went to one’s heart to seehim. I tried to drive him before me and bring him to you, but he isalready so wild and shy that when I went near him he made off into thethickest part of the forest. If you have a mind that we two should goback and look for him, let me put up this she-ass at my house and I’llbe back at once.’ ‘You will be doing me a great kindness,’ said theowner of the ass, ‘and I’ll try to pay it back in the same coin.’ It iswith all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling itnow, that those who know all about the matter tell the story. Wellthen, the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, andcoming to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could notfind him, nor was he to be seen anywhere about, search as they might.Seeing, then, that there was no sign of him, the regidor who had seenhim said to the other, ‘Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me,by which, beyond a doubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, evenif he is stowed away in the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest.Here it is. I can bray to perfection, and if you can ever so little,the thing’s as good as done.’ ‘Ever so little did you say, gossip?’said the other; ‘by God, I’ll not give in to anybody, not even to theasses themselves.’ ‘We’ll soon see,’ said the second regidor, ‘for myplan is that you should go one side of the forest, and I the other, soas to go all round about it; and every now and then you will bray and Iwill bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answerus if he is in the forest.’ To which the owner of the ass replied,‘It’s an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and worthy of your greatgenius;’ and the two separating as agreed, it so fell out that theybrayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived by the braying ofthe other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last. Whenthey came in sight of one another, said the loser, ‘Is it possible,gossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?’ ‘No, it was I,’ said theother. ‘Well then, I can tell you, gossip,’ said the ass’s owner, ‘thatbetween you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far asbraying goes, for I never in all my life saw or heard anything morenatural.’ ‘Those praises and compliments belong to you more justly thanto me, gossip,’ said the inventor of the plan; ‘for, by the God thatmade me, you might give a couple of brays odds to the best and mostfinished brayer in the world; the tone you have got is deep, your voiceis well kept up as to time and pitch, and your finishing notes comethick and fast; in fact, I own myself beaten, and yield the palm toyou, and give in to you in this rare accomplishment.’ ‘Well then,’ saidthe owner, ‘I’ll set a higher value on myself for the future, andconsider that I know something, as I have an excellence of some sort;for though I always thought I brayed well, I never supposed I came upto the pitch of perfection you say.’ ‘And I say too,’ said the second,‘that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world, and that theyare ill bestowed upon those who don’t know how to make use of them.’‘Ours,’ said the owner of the ass, ‘unless it is in cases like this wehave now in hand, cannot be of any service to us, and even in this Godgrant they may be of some use.’ So saying they separated, and took totheir braying once more, but every instant they were deceiving oneanother, and coming to meet one another again, until they arranged byway of countersign, so as to know that it was they and not the ass, togive two brays, one after the other. In this way, doubling the brays atevery step, they made the complete circuit of the forest, but the lostass never gave them an answer or even the sign of one. How could thepoor ill-starred brute have answered, when, in the thickest part of theforest, they found him devoured by wolves? As soon as he saw him hisowner said, ‘I was wondering he did not answer, for if he wasn’t deadhe’d have brayed when he heard us, or he’d have been no ass; but forthe sake of having heard you bray to such perfection, gossip, I countthe trouble I have taken to look for him well bestowed, even though Ihave found him dead.’ ‘It’s in a good hand, gossip,’ said the other;‘if the abbot sings well, the acolyte is not much behind him.’ So theyreturned disconsolate and hoarse to their village, where they toldtheir friends, neighbours, and acquaintances what had befallen them intheir search for the ass, each crying up the other’s perfection inbraying. The whole story came to be known and spread abroad through thevillages of the neighbourhood; and the devil, who never sleeps, withhis love for sowing dissensions and scattering discord everywhere,blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of nothing, contrived tomake the people of the other towns fall to braying whenever they sawanyone from our village, as if to throw the braying of our regidors inour teeth. Then the boys took to it, which was the same thing for it asgetting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell; andbraying spread from one town to another in such a way that the men ofthe braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known fromwhites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times thescoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with thescoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters.To-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, ofthe braying town, are going to take the field against another villagetwo leagues away from ours, one of those that persecute us most; andthat we may turn out well prepared I have bought these lances andhalberds you have seen. These are the curious things I told you I hadto tell, and if you don’t think them so, I have got no others;” andwith this the worthy fellow brought his story to a close.Just at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirelyclad in chamois leather, hose, breeches, and doublet, who said in aloud voice, “Señor host, have you room? Here’s the divining ape and theshow of the Release of Melisendra just coming.”“Ods body!” said the landlord, “why, it’s Master Pedro! We’re in for agrand night!” I forgot to mention that the said Master Pedro had hisleft eye and nearly half his cheek covered with a patch of greentaffety, showing that something ailed all that side. “Your worship iswelcome, Master Pedro,” continued the landlord; “but where are the apeand the show, for I don’t see them?” “They are close at hand,” said hein the chamois leather, “but I came on first to know if there was anyroom.” “I’d make the Duke of Alva himself clear out to make room forMaster Pedro,” said the landlord; “bring in the ape and the show;there’s company in the inn to-night that will pay to see that and thecleverness of the ape.” “So be it by all means,” said the man with thepatch; “I’ll lower the price, and be well satisfied if I only pay myexpenses; and now I’ll go back and hurry on the cart with the ape andthe show;” and with this he went out of the inn.Don Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, andwhat was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which thelandlord replied, “This is a famous puppet-showman, who for some timepast has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show ofthe release of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the bestand best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of thekingdom for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the mostextraordinary gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being;for if you ask him anything, he listens attentively to the question,and then jumps on his master’s shoulder, and pressing close to his eartells him the answer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a greatdeal more about things past than about things to come; and though hedoes not always hit the truth in every case, most times he is not farwrong, so that he makes us fancy he has got the devil in him. He getstwo reals for every question if the ape answers; I mean if his masteranswers for him after he has whispered into his ear; and so it isbelieved that this same Master Pedro is very rich. He is a ‘gallantman’ as they say in Italy, and good company, and leads the finest lifein the world; talks more than six, drinks more than a dozen, and all byhis tongue, and his ape, and his show.”Master Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and theape—a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, butnot vicious-looking. As soon as Don Quixote saw him, he asked him, “Canyou tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will itbe with us? See, here are my two reals,” and he bade Sancho give themto Master Pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, “Señor, thisanimal does not give any answer or information touching things that areto come; of things past he knows something, and more or less of thingspresent.”“Gad,” said Sancho, “I would not give a farthing to be told what’s pastwith me, for who knows that better than I do myself? And to pay forbeing told what I know would be mighty foolish. But as you know thingspresent, here are my two reals, and tell me, most excellent sir ape,what is my wife Teresa Panza doing now, and what is she divertingherself with?”Master Pedro refused to take the money, saying, “I will not receivepayment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;” andthen with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his leftshoulder, and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, andputting his mouth to his master’s ear began chattering his teethrapidly; and having kept this up as long as one would be saying acredo, with another spring he brought himself to the ground, and thesame instant Master Pedro ran in great haste and fell upon his kneesbefore Don Quixote, and embracing his legs exclaimed, “These legs do Iembrace as I would embrace the two pillars of Hercules, O illustriousreviver of knight-errantry, so long consigned to oblivion! O never yetduly extolled knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, courage of thefaint-hearted, prop of the tottering, arm of the fallen, staff andcounsel of all who are unfortunate!”p25b.jpg (373K)Full SizeDon Quixote was thunderstruck, Sancho astounded, the cousin staggered,the page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlordin perplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of thepuppet-showman, who went on to say, “And thou, worthy Sancho Panza, thebest squire and squire to the best knight in the world! Be of goodcheer, for thy good wife Teresa is well, and she is at this momenthackling a pound of flax; and more by token she has at her left hand ajug with a broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which shesolaces herself at her work.”“That I can well believe,” said Sancho. “She is a lucky one, and if itwas not for her jealousy I would not change her for the giantessAndandona, who by my master’s account was a very clever and worthywoman; my Teresa is one of those that won’t let themselves want foranything, though their heirs may have to pay for it.”“Now I declare,” said Don Quixote, “he who reads much and travels muchsees and knows a great deal. I say so because what amount of persuasioncould have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that candivine as I have seen now with my own eyes? For I am that very DonQuixote of La Mancha this worthy animal refers to, though he has gonerather too far in my praise; but whatever I may be, I thank heaven thatit has endowed me with a tender and compassionate heart, alwaysdisposed to do good to all and harm to none.”“If I had money,” said the page, “I would ask señor ape what willhappen to me in the peregrination I am making.”To this Master Pedro, who had by this time risen from Don Quixote’sfeet, replied, “I have already said that this little beast gives noanswer as to the future; but if he did, not having money would be of noconsequence, for to oblige Señor Don Quixote, here present, I wouldgive up all the profits in the world. And now, because I have promisedit, and to afford him pleasure, I will set up my show and offerentertainment to all who are in the inn, without any charge whatever.”As soon as he heard this, the landlord, delighted beyond measure,pointed out a place where the show might be fixed, which was done atonce.Don Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of theape, as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything,either past or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, heretired with Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without beingoverheard by anyone, he said to him, “Look here, Sancho, I have beenseriously thinking over this ape’s extraordinary gift, and have come tothe conclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has apact, tacit or express, with the devil.”“If the packet is express from the devil,” said Sancho, “it must be avery dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do Master Pedro tohave such packets?”“Thou dost not understand me, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “I only meanhe must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power intothe ape, that he may get his living, and after he has grown rich hewill give him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; thisI am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers about thingspast or present, and the devil’s knowledge extends no further; for thefuture he knows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it isreserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, and for himthere is neither past nor future; all is present. This being as it is,it is clear that this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil; and I amastonished they have not denounced him to the Holy Office, and put himto the question, and forced it out of him by whose virtue it is that hedivines; because it is certain this ape is not an astrologer; neitherhis master nor he sets up, or knows how to set up, those figures theycall judiciary, which are now so common in Spain that there is not ajade, or page, or old cobbler, that will not undertake to set up afigure as readily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground, bringingto nought the marvellous truth of the science by their lies andignorance. I know of a lady who asked one of these figure schemerswhether her little lap-dog would be in pup and would breed, and howmany and of what colour the little pups would be. To which señorastrologer, after having set up his figure, made answer that the bitchwould be in pup, and would drop three pups, one green, another brightred, and the third parti-coloured, provided she conceived betweeneleven and twelve either of the day or night, and on a Monday orSaturday; but as things turned out, two days after this the bitch diedof a surfeit, and señor planet-ruler had the credit all over the placeof being a most profound astrologer, as most of these planet-rulershave.”“Still,” said Sancho, “I would be glad if your worship would makeMaster Pedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship in the caveof Montesinos is true; for, begging your worship’s pardon, I, for mypart, take it to have been all flam and lies, or at any rate somethingyou dreamt.”“That may be,” replied Don Quixote; “however, I will do what yousuggest; though I have my own scruples about it.”At this point Master Pedro came up in quest of Don Quixote, to tell himthe show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at onceto tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in thecave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appearedto partake of both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, wentback to fetch the ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixoteand Sancho, said: “See here, señor ape, this gentleman wishes to knowwhether certain things which happened to him in the cave called thecave of Montesinos were false or true.” On his making the usual signthe ape mounted on his left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear,and Master Pedro said at once, “The ape says that the things you saw orthat happened to you in that cave are, part of them false, part true;and that he only knows this and no more as regards this question; butif your worship wishes to know more, on Friday next he will answer allthat may be asked him, for his virtue is at present exhausted, and willnot return to him till Friday, as he has said.”“Did I not say, señor,” said Sancho, “that I could not bring myself tobelieve that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave wastrue, or even the half of it?”“The course of events will tell, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “time,that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag intothe light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth. Butenough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro’s show,for I am sure there must be something novel in it.”“Something!” said Master Pedro; “this show of mine has sixty thousandnovel things in it; let me tell you, Señor Don Quixote, it is one ofthe best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but _operibuscredite et non verbis_, and now let’s get to work, for it is growinglate, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.”Don Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show wasalready put up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax taperswhich made it look splendid and bright. When they came to it MasterPedro ensconced himself inside it, for it was he who had to work thepuppets, and a boy, a servant of his, posted himself outside to act asshowman and explain the mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand inhis hand to point to the figures as they came out. And so, all who werein the inn being arranged in front of the show, some of them standing,and Don Quixote, Sancho, the page, and cousin, accommodated with thebest places, the interpreter began to say what he will hear or see whoreads or hears the next chapter.p25e.jpg (28K)CHAPTER XXVI.WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE DROLL ADVENTURE OF THE PUPPET-SHOWMAN,TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS IN TRUTH RIGHT GOODp26a.jpg (157K)Full SizeAll were silent, Tyrians and Trojans; I mean all who were watching theshow were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders, whendrums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off.The noise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his voice and said,“This true story which is here represented to your worships is takenword for word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish balladsthat are in everybody’s mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about thestreets. Its subject is the release by Señor Don Gaiferos of his wifeMelisendra, when a captive in Spain at the hands of the Moors in thecity of Sansueña, for so they called then what is now called Saragossa;and there you may see how Don Gaiferos is playing at the tables, justas they sing it—At tables playing Don Gaiferos sits,For Melisendra is forgotten now.And that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and asceptre in his hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father ofMelisendra, who, angered to see his son-in-law’s inaction andunconcern, comes in to chide him; and observe with what vehemence andenergy he chides him, so that you would fancy he was going to give himhalf a dozen raps with his sceptre; and indeed there are authors whosay he did give them, and sound ones too; and after having said a greatdeal to him about imperilling his honour by not effecting the releaseof his wife, he said, so the tale runs,Enough I’ve said, see to it now.Observe, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferosfuming; and you see now how in a burst of anger, he flings the tableand the board far from him and calls in haste for his armour, and askshis cousin Don Roland for the loan of his sword, Durindana, and how DonRoland refuses to lend it, offering him his company in the difficultenterprise he is undertaking; but he, in his valour and anger, will notaccept it, and says that he alone will suffice to rescue his wife, eventhough she were imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and withthis he retires to arm himself and set out on his journey at once. Nowlet your worships turn your eyes to that tower that appears there,which is supposed to be one of the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa,now called the Aljaferia; that lady who appears on that balcony dressedin Moorish fashion is the peerless Melisendra, for many a time she usedto gaze from thence upon the road to France, and seek consolation inher captivity by thinking of Paris and her husband. Observe, too, a newincident which now occurs, such as, perhaps, never was seen. Do you notsee that Moor, who silently and stealthily, with his finger on his lip,approaches Melisendra from behind? Observe now how he prints a kissupon her lips, and what a hurry she is in to spit, and wipe them withthe white sleeve of her smock, and how she bewails herself, and tearsher fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong. Observe, too,that the stately Moor who is in that corridor is King Marsilio ofSansueña, who, having seen the Moor’s insolence, at once orders him(though his kinsman and a great favourite of his) to be seized andgiven two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets of the cityaccording to custom, with criers going before him and officers ofjustice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence,although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moorsthere are no indictments nor remands as with us.”Here Don Quixote called out, “Child, child, go straight on with yourstory, and don’t run into curves and slants, for to establish a factclearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;” andsaid Master Pedro from within, “Boy, stick to your text and do as thegentleman bids you; it’s the best plan; keep to your plain song, anddon’t attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being overfine.”“I will,” said the boy, and he went on to say, “This figure that yousee here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don Gaiferoshimself, whom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous Moor,and taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and moretranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him; and sheaddresses her husband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holdswith him all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs—If you, sir knight, to France are bound,Oh! for Gaiferos ask—which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice itto observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyfulgestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more,we now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on thehaunches of her good husband’s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge ofher petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she isleft hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see howcompassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferosadvances, and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn ornot, he seizes her and by force brings her to the ground, and then withone jerk places her on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man,and bids her hold on tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossingthem on his breast so as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was notused to that style of riding. You see, too, how the neighing of thehorse shows his satisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden hebears in his lord and lady. You see how they wheel round and quit thecity, and in joy and gladness take the road to Paris. Go in peace, Opeerless pair of true lovers! May you reach your longed-for fatherlandin safety, and may fortune interpose no impediment to your prosperousjourney; may the eyes of your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoyingin peace and tranquillity the remaining days of your life—and that theymay be as many as those of Nestor!”Here Master Pedro called out again and said, “Simplicity, boy! None ofyour high flights; all affectation is bad.”The interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, “There was no wantof idle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down andmount, and word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave ordersto sound the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city isdrowned with the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all themosques.”“Nay, nay,” said Don Quixote at this; “on that point of the bellsMaster Pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among theMoors; only kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like ourclarion; to ring bells this way in Sansueña is unquestionably a greatabsurdity.”On hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, “Don’t lookinto trifles, Señor Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitchof perfection that is out of reach. Are there not almost every day athousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands ofinaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successfulrun, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admirationand all the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don’t mind; for so long as Ifill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there aremotes in a sunbeam.”“True enough,” said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: “See what anumerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city inpursuit of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets thereis, what sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear methey will overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of theirown horse, which would be a dreadful sight.”p26b.jpg (342K)Full SizeDon Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such adin, thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up heexclaimed in a loud voice, “Never, while I live, will I permit foulplay to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight andfearless lover as Don Gaiferos. Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him notnor pursue him, or ye will have to reckon with me in battle!” andsuiting the action to the word, he drew his sword, and with one boundplaced himself close to the show, and with unexampled rapidity and furybegan to shower down blows on the puppet troop of Moors, knocking oversome, decapitating others, maiming this one and demolishing that; andamong many more he delivered one down stroke which, if Master Pedro hadnot ducked, made himself small, and got out of the way, would havesliced off his head as easily as if it had been made of almond-paste.Master Pedro kept shouting, “Hold hard! Señor Don Quixote! can’t yousee they’re not real Moors you’re knocking down and killing anddestroying, but only little pasteboard figures! Look—sinner that Iam!—how you’re wrecking and ruining all that I’m worth!” But in spiteof this, Don Quixote did not leave off discharging a continuous rain ofcuts, slashes, downstrokes, and backstrokes, and at length, in lessthan the space of two credos, he brought the whole show to the ground,with all its fittings and figures shivered and knocked to pieces, KingMarsilio badly wounded, and the Emperor Charlemagne with his crown andhead split in two. The whole audience was thrown into confusion, theape fled to the roof of the inn, the cousin was frightened, and evenSancho Panza himself was in mighty fear, for, as he swore after thestorm was over, he had never seen his master in such a furious passion.The complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, DonQuixote became a little calmer, said, “I wish I had here before me nowall those who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant arein the world; just think, if I had not been here present, what wouldhave become of the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra! Dependupon it, by this time those dogs would have overtaken them andinflicted some outrage upon them. So, then, long live knight-errantrybeyond everything living on earth this day!”“Let it live, and welcome,” said Master Pedro at this in a feeblevoice, “and let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I can say withKing Don Rodrigo—Yesterday was I lord of SpainTo-day I’ve not a turret leftThat I may call mine own.Not half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kingsand emperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and mytrunks and bags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myselfruined and laid low, destitute and a beggar, and above all without myape, for, by my faith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I havehim caught; and all through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who,they say, protects the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does othercharitable deeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wantingin my case only, blessed and praised be the highest heavens! Verily,knight of the rueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine.”Sancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro’s words, and said to him,“Don’t weep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; let me tellyou my master, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a Christianthat, if he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will ownit, and be willing to pay for it and make it good, and something overand above.”“Only let Señor Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he hasdestroyed,” said Master Pedro, “and I would be content, and his worshipwould ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keeps what isanother’s against the owner’s will, and makes no restitution.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “but at present I am not aware that Ihave got anything of yours, Master Pedro.”“What!” returned Master Pedro; “and these relics lying here on the barehard ground—what scattered and shattered them but the invinciblestrength of that mighty arm? And whose were the bodies they belonged tobut mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?”“Now am I fully convinced,” said Don Quixote, “of what I had many atime before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do nothingmore than put figures like these before my eyes, and then change andturn them into what they please. In truth and earnest, I assure yougentlemen who now hear me, that to me everything that has taken placehere seemed to take place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra,Don Gaiferos Don Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and CharlemagneCharlemagne. That was why my anger was roused; and to be faithful to mycalling as a knight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to thosewho fled, and with this good intention I did what you have seen. If theresult has been the opposite of what I intended, it is no fault ofmine, but of those wicked beings that persecute me; but, for all that,I am willing to condemn myself in costs for this error of mine, thoughit did not proceed from malice; let Master Pedro see what he wants forthe spoiled figures, for I agree to pay it at once in good and currentmoney of Castile.”Master Pedro made him a bow, saying, “I expected no less of the rareChristianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper andprotector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord hereand the great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisersbetween your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worthor may be worth.”The landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up fromthe ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his head off, and said,“Here you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his formerstate, so I think, saving your better judgments, that for his death,decease, and demise, four reals and a half may be given me.”“Proceed,” said Don Quixote.“Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,” continued MasterPedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, “it would not be muchif I were to ask five reals and a quarter.”“It’s not little,” said Sancho.“Nor is it much,” said the landlord; “make it even, and say fivereals.”“Let him have the whole five and a quarter,” said Don Quixote; “for thesum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more orless; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it’s getting onto supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.”“For this figure,” said Master Pedro, “that is without a nose, andwants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am reasonable inmy charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.”“The very devil must be in it,” said Don Quixote, “if Melisendra andher husband are not by this time at least on the French border, for thehorse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop; so youneedn’t try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here a noselessMelisendra when she is now, may be, enjoying herself at her ease withher husband in France. God help every one to his own, Master Pedro, andlet us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.”Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, andreturn to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so hesaid to him, “This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damselsthat waited on her; so if I’m given sixty maravedis for her, I’ll becontent and sufficiently paid.”And so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfactionof both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over andabove this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked fortwo reals for his trouble in catching the ape.“Let him have them, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not to catch the ape,but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the goodnews, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady DoñaMelisandra and Señor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their ownpeople.”“No one could tell us that better than my ape,” said Master Pedro; “butthere’s no devil that could catch him now; I suspect, however, thataffection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night;but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.”In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace andgood fellowship at Don Quixote’s expense, for he was the height ofgenerosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberdstook his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the pagecame to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latterresuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave himtwelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaverwith Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun,and having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, hetoo went off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know DonQuixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity.To conclude, Sancho, by his master’s orders, paid him very liberally,and taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in themorning and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue theirjourney, for this is necessary in order to allow certain other mattersto be set forth, which are required to clear up this famous history.p26e.jpg (34K)CHAPTER XXVII.WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN WHO MASTER PEDRO AND HIS APE WERE, TOGETHER WITHTHE MISHAP DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, WHICH HE DID NOTCONCLUDE AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED OR AS HE HAD EXPECTEDp27a.jpg (135K)Full SizeCide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapterwith these words, “I swear as a Catholic Christian;” with regard towhich his translator says that Cide Hamete’s swearing as a CatholicChristian, he being—as no doubt he was—a Moor, only meant that, just asa Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what istrue, and tell the truth in what he avers, so he was telling the truth,as much as if he swore as a Catholic Christian, in all he chose towrite about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro was andwhat was the divining ape that astonished all the villages with hisdivinations. He says, then, that he who has read the First Part of thishistory will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, withother galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: akindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment fromthat evil-minded, ill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte—DonGinesillo de Parapilla, Don Quixote called him—it was that stole Dapplefrom Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printers neitherthe how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been a puzzle toa good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of the author whatwas the error of the press. In fact, however, Gines stole him whileSancho Panza was asleep on his back, adopting the plan and device thatBrunello had recourse to when he stole Sacripante’s horse from betweenhis legs at the siege of Albracca; and, as has been told, Sanchoafterwards recovered him. This Gines, then, afraid of being caught bythe officers of justice, who were looking for him to punish him for hisnumberless rascalities and offences (which were so many and so greatthat he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them), resolvedto shift his quarters into the kingdom of Aragon, and cover up his lefteye, and take up the trade of a puppet-showman; for this, as well asjuggling, he knew how to practise to perfection. From some releasedChristians returning from Barbary, it so happened, he bought the ape,which he taught to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certainsign, and to whisper, or seem to do so, in his ear. Thus prepared,before entering any village whither he was bound with his show and hisape, he used to inform himself at the nearest village, or from the mostlikely person he could find, as to what particular things had happenedthere, and to whom; and bearing them well in mind, the first thing hedid was to exhibit his show, sometimes one story, sometimes another,but all lively, amusing, and familiar. As soon as the exhibition wasover he brought forward the accomplishments of his ape, assuring thepublic that he divined all the past and the present, but as to thefuture he had no skill. For each question answered he asked two reals,and for some he made a reduction, just as he happened to feel the pulseof the questioners; and when now and then he came to houses wherethings that he knew of had happened to the people living there, even ifthey did not ask him a question, not caring to pay for it, he wouldmake the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so,which fitted the case exactly. In this way he acquired a prodigiousname and all ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, hewould answer in such a way that the answers suited the questions; andas no one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his apedivined, he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. The instant heentered the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledgeit was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; but itwould have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a littlelower when he cut off King Marsilio’s head and destroyed all hishorsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter.So much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixoteof La Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, firstof all, the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before enteringthe city of Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to sparebefore the jousts left him enough for all. With this object in view hefollowed the road and travelled along it for two days, without meetingany adventure worth committing to writing until on the third day, as hewas ascending a hill, he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, andmusket-shots. At first he imagined some regiment of soldiers waspassing that way, and to see them he spurred Rocinante and mounted thehill. On reaching the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundredmen, as it seemed to him, armed with weapons of various sorts, lances,crossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and agreat many bucklers. He descended the slope and approached the bandnear enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours anddistinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard orensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-likestyle an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open andits tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying; andround it were inscribed in large characters these two lines—They did not bray in vain,Our alcaldes twain.From this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be fromthe braying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what waswritten on the standard. At the same time be observed that the man whohad told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two whobrayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard theywere alcaldes. To which Sancho replied, “Señor, there’s nothing tostick at in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to bealcaldes of their town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles;moreover, it has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether thebrayers were alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray;for an alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor.” They perceived,in short, clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned outto do battle with some other that had jeered it more than was fair orneighbourly.Don Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho’suneasiness, for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions ofthat sort. The members of the troop received him into the midst ofthem, taking him to be someone who was on their side. Don Quixote,putting up his visor, advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour tothe standard with the ass, and all the chief men of the army gatheredround him to look at him, staring at him with the usual amazement thateverybody felt on seeing him for the first time. Don Quixote, seeingthem examining him so attentively, and that none of them spoke to himor put any question to him, determined to take advantage of theirsilence; so, breaking his own, he lifted up his voice and said, “Worthysirs, I entreat you as earnestly as I can not to interrupt an argumentI wish to address to you, until you find it displeases or wearies you;and if that come to pass, on the slightest hint you give me I will puta seal upon my lips and a gag upon my tongue.”They all bade him say what he liked, for they would listen to himwillingly.p27b.jpg (330K)Full SizeWith this permission Don Quixote went on to say, “I, sirs, am aknight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is toprotect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand inneed of it. Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune andthe cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revengeyourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over yourbusiness in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, youare mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individualcannot insult an entire community; unless it be by defying itcollectively as a traitor, because he cannot tell who in particular isguilty of the treason for which he defies it. Of this we have anexample in Don Diego Ordoñez de Lara, who defied the whole town ofZamora, because he did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committedthe treachery of slaying his king; and therefore he defied them all,and the vengeance and the reply concerned all; though, to be sure,Señor Don Diego went rather too far, indeed very much beyond the limitsof a defiance; for he had no occasion to defy the dead, or the waters,or the fishes, or those yet unborn, and all the rest of it as setforth; but let that pass, for when anger breaks out there’s no father,governor, or bridle to check the tongue. The case being, then, that noone person can insult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entirecommunity, it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge thedefiance of such an insult, inasmuch as it is not one. A fine thing itwould be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheadsevery moment with everyone who called them by that name,—or theCazoleros, Berengeneros, Ballenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of allthe other names and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys andcommon people! It would be a nice business indeed if all theseillustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and goabout perpetually making trombones of their swords in every pettyquarrel! No, no; God forbid! There are four things for which sensiblemen and well-ordered States ought to take up arms, draw their swords,and risk their persons, lives, and properties. The first is to defendthe Catholic faith; the second, to defend one’s life, which is inaccordance with natural and divine law; the third, in defence of one’shonour, family, and property; the fourth, in the service of one’s kingin a just war; and if to these we choose to add a fifth (which may beincluded in the second), in defence of one’s country. To these five, asit were capital causes, there may be added some others that may be justand reasonable, and make it a duty to take up arms; but to take them upfor trifles and things to laugh at and be amused by rather thanoffended, looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting incommon sense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and there cannot beany just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that weacknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and tolove them that hate us; a command which, though it seems somewhatdifficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of Godthan of the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for JesusChrist, God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie,said, as our law-giver, that his yoke was easy and his burden light; hewould not, therefore, have laid any command upon us that it wasimpossible to obey. Thus, sirs, you are bound to keep quiet by humanand divine law.”“The devil take me,” said Sancho to himself at this, “but this masterof mine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he’s as like one as one eggis like another.”Don Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence wasstill preserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would havedone so had not Sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeinghis master pause, took the lead, saying, “My lord Don Quixote of LaMancha, who once was called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, butnow is called the Knight of the Lions, is a gentleman of greatdiscretion who knows Latin and his mother tongue like a bachelor, andin everything that he deals with or advises proceeds like a goodsoldier, and has all the laws and ordinances of what they call combatat his fingers’ ends; so you have nothing to do but to let yourselvesbe guided by what he says, and on my head be it if it is wrong. Besideswhich, you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merelyhearing a bray. I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I hada fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturallythat when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was nonethe less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected; andthough I was envied because of the gift by more than one of the highand mighty ones of the town, I did not care two farthings for it; andthat you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, forthis art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;” and then,taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all thevalleys around rang again.One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mockingthem, lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such ablow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote,seeing him so roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck himlance in hand, but so many thrust themselves between them that he couldnot avenge him. Far from it, finding a shower of stones rained uponhim, and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeledRocinante round and, as fast as his best gallop could take him, fledfrom the midst of them, commending himself to God with all his heart todeliver him out of this peril, in dread every step of some ball comingin at his back and coming out at his breast, and every minute drawinghis breath to see whether it had gone from him. The members of theband, however, were satisfied with seeing him take to flight, and didnot fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcely restored to his senses,on his ass, and let him go after his master; not that he wassufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but Dapple followed thefootsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not remain a momentseparated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, and seeingSancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one followedhim. The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as theenemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town exulting;and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they wouldhave erected a trophy on the spot.p27e.jpg (47K)Full SizeCHAPTER XXVIII.OF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF HE READSTHEM WITH ATTENTIONp28a.jpg (111K)Full SizeWhen the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise mento reserve themselves for better occasions. This proved to be the casewith Don Quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk andthe hostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, withouta thought of Sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him,retreated to such a distance as he thought made him safe. Sancho, lyingacross his ass, followed him, as has been said, and at length came up,having by this time recovered his senses, and on joining him lethimself drop off Dapple at Rocinante’s feet, sore, bruised, andbelaboured. Don Quixote dismounted to examine his wounds, but findinghim whole from head to foot, he said to him, angrily enough, “In anevil hour didst thou take to braying, Sancho! Where hast thou learnedthat it is well done to mention the rope in the house of the man thathas been hanged? To the music of brays what harmonies couldst thouexpect to get but cudgels? Give thanks to God, Sancho, that they signedthe cross on thee just now with a stick, and did not mark thee _persignum crucis_ with a cutlass.”“I’m not equal to answering,” said Sancho, “for I feel as if I wasspeaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away from this;I’ll keep from braying, but not from saying that knights-errant fly andleave their good squires to be pounded like privet, or made meal of atthe hands of their enemies.”“He does not fly who retires,” returned Don Quixote; “for I would havethee know, Sancho, that the valour which is not based upon a foundationof prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rash man are tobe attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so I own thatI retired, but not that I fled; and therein I have followed the exampleof many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times; thehistories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be anygood to thee or pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now.”Sancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who thenhimself mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded totake shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a leagueoff. Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismalgroans, and on Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering,he replied that, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of hisneck, he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.“The cause of that soreness,” said Don Quixote, “will be, no doubt,that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one, itcaught thee all down the back, where all the parts that are sore aresituated, and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still.”“By God,” said Sancho, “your worship has relieved me of a great doubt,and cleared up the point for me in elegant style! Body o’ me! is thecause of my soreness such a mystery that there’s any need to tell me Iam sore everywhere the staff hit me? If it was my ankles that pained methere might be something in going divining why they did, but it is notmuch to divine that I’m sore where they thrashed me. By my faith,master mine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I amdiscovering more and more how little I have to hope for from keepingcompany with your worship; for if this time you have allowed me to bedrubbed, the next time, or a hundred times more, we’ll have theblanketings of the other day over again, and all the other prankswhich, if they have fallen on my shoulders now, will be thrown in myteeth by-and-by. I would do a great deal better (if I was not anignorant brute that will never do any good all my life), I would do agreat deal better, I say, to go home to my wife and children andsupport them and bring them up on what God may please to give me,instead of following your worship along roads that lead nowhere andpaths that are none at all, with little to drink and less to eat. Andthen when it comes to sleeping! Measure out seven feet on the earth,brother squire, and if that’s not enough for you, take as many more,for you may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to yourheart’s content. Oh that I could see burnt and turned to ashes thefirst man that meddled with knight-errantry or at any rate the firstwho chose to be squire to such fools as all the knights-errant of pasttimes must have been! Of those of the present day I say nothing,because, as your worship is one of them, I respect them, and because Iknow your worship knows a point more than the devil in all you say andthink.”“I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thatnow that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you don’t feela pain in your whole body. Talk away, my son, say whatever comes intoyour head or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain, the irritationyour impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if you are soanxious to go home to your wife and children, God forbid that I shouldprevent you; you have money of mine; see how long it is since we leftour village this third time, and how much you can and ought to earnevery month, and pay yourself out of your own hand.”“When I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor SamsonCarrasco that your worship knows,” replied Sancho, “I used to earn twoducats a month besides my food; I can’t tell what I can earn with yourworship, though I know a knight-errant’s squire has harder times of itthan he who works for a farmer; for after all, we who work for farmers,however much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, we have our ollasupper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since I have beenin your worship’s service, if it wasn’t the short time we were in DonDiego de Miranda’s house, and the feast I had with the skimmings I tookoff Camacho’s pots, and what I ate, drank, and slept in Basilio’shouse; all the rest of the time I have been sleeping on the hard groundunder the open sky, exposed to what they call the inclemencies ofheaven, keeping life in me with scraps of cheese and crusts of bread,and drinking water either from the brooks or from the springs we cometo on these by-paths we travel.”“I own, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that all thou sayest is true; howmuch, thinkest thou, ought I to give thee over and above what TomCarrasco gave thee?”“I think,” said Sancho, “that if your worship was to add on two reals amonth I’d consider myself well paid; that is, as far as the wages of mylabour go; but to make up to me for your worship’s pledge and promiseto me to give me the government of an island, it would be fair to addsix reals more, making thirty in all.”“Very good,” said Don Quixote; “it is twenty-five days since we leftour village, so reckon up, Sancho, according to the wages you have madeout for yourself, and see how much I owe you in proportion, and payyourself, as I said before, out of your own hand.”“O body o’ me!” said Sancho, “but your worship is very much out in thatreckoning; for when it comes to the promise of the island we must countfrom the day your worship promised it to me to this present hour we areat now.”“Well, how long is it, Sancho, since I promised it to you?” said DonQuixote.“If I remember rightly,” said Sancho, “it must be over twenty years,three days more or less.”Don Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began tolaugh heartily, and said he, “Why, I have not been wandering, either inthe Sierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely twomonths, and thou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years since Ipromised thee the island. I believe now thou wouldst have all the moneythou hast of mine go in thy wages. If so, and if that be thy pleasure,I give it to thee now, once and for all, and much good may it do thee,for so long as I see myself rid of such a good-for-nothing squire I’llbe glad to be left a pauper without a rap. But tell me, thou perverterof the squirely rules of knight-errantry, where hast thou ever seen orread that any knight-errant’s squire made terms with his lord, ‘youmust give me so much a month for serving you’? Plunge, scoundrel,rogue, monster—for such I take thee to be—plunge, I say, into the _maremagnum_ of their histories; and if thou shalt find that any squire eversaid or thought what thou hast said now, I will let thee nail it on myforehead, and give me, over and above, four sound slaps in the face.Turn the rein, or the halter, of thy Dapple, and begone home; for onesingle step further thou shalt not make in my company. O breadthanklessly received! O promises ill-bestowed! O man more beast thanhuman being! Now, when I was about to raise thee to such a position,that, in spite of thy wife, they would call thee ‘my lord,’ thou artleaving me? Thou art going now when I had a firm and fixed intention ofmaking thee lord of the best island in the world? Well, as thou thyselfhast said before now, honey is not for the mouth of the ass. Ass thouart, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou wilt end when the course of thylife is run; for I know it will come to its close before thou dostperceive or discern that thou art a beast.”Sancho regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he was giving him thisrating, and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes,and in a piteous and broken voice he said to him, “Master mine, Iconfess that, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if yourworship will only fix one on to me, I’ll look on it as rightly placed,and I’ll serve you as an ass all the remaining days of my life. Forgiveme and have pity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if Italk much, it’s more from infirmity than malice; but he who sins andmends commends himself to God.”“I should have been surprised, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “if thouhadst not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech. Well, well,I forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in futureso fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and takeheart, and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of mypromises, which, by being delayed, does not become impossible.”Sancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart as best he could.They then entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled himself at thefoot of an elm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kindand others like them always have feet but no hands. Sancho passed thenight in pain, for with the evening dews the blow of the staff madeitself felt all the more. Don Quixote passed it in his never-failingmeditations; but, for all that, they had some winks of sleep, and withthe appearance of daylight they pursued their journey in quest of thebanks of the famous Ebro, where that befell them which will be told inthe following chapter.p28e.jpg (36K)CHAPTER XXIX.OF THE FAMOUS ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED BARKp29a.jpg (127K)Full SizeBy stages as already described or left undescribed, two days afterquitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, andthe sight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplatedand gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream,the gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters;and the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind.Above all, he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos;for though Master Pedro’s ape had told him that of those things partwas true, part false, he clung more to their truth than to theirfalsehood, the very reverse of Sancho, who held them all to bedownright lies.As they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat,without oars or any other gear, that lay at the water’s edge tied tothe stem of a tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round,and seeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinanteand bade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely tothe trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him thereason of this sudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer,“Thou must know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without thepossibility of any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it,and in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinctionin need of it, who is no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the wayof the books of chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak inthem. When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannotbe delivered save by the hand of another knight, though they may be ata distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other,they either take him up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him toget into, and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him wherethey will and where his help is required; and so, Sancho, this bark isplaced here for the same purpose; this is as true as that it is nowday, and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together, andthen in God’s hand be it to guide us; for I would not hold back fromembarking, though barefooted friars were to beg me.”“As that’s the case,” said Sancho, “and your worship chooses to give into these—I don’t know if I may call them absurdities—at every turn,there’s nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mindthe proverb, ‘Do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table withhim;’ but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, I warnyour worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, butbelongs to some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the bestshad in the world here.”As Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care andprotection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. DonQuixote bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, “for he whowould carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions wouldtake care to feed them.”“I don’t understand that logiquous,” said Sancho, “nor have I everheard the word all the days of my life.”“Longinquous,” replied Don Quixote, “means far off; but it is no wonderthou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound to know Latin, likesome who pretend to know it and don’t.”“Now they are tied,” said Sancho; “what are we to do next?”“What?” said Don Quixote, “cross ourselves and weigh anchor; I mean,embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;” and the barkbegan to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho saw himselfsomewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble andgive himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearingDapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said heto his master, “Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, andRocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends,peace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away fromyou, turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.” And with this hefell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply andangrily, “What art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thouweeping at, heart of butter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thousoul of a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the veryheart of abundance? Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over theRiphaean mountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archdukeon the tranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a shortspace we shall come out upon the broad sea? But we must have alreadyemerged and gone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I hadhere an astrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell theehow many we have travelled, though either I know little, or we havealready crossed or shall shortly cross the equinoctial line which partsthe two opposite poles midway.”“And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,” said Sancho,“how far shall we have gone?”“Very far,” said Don Quixote, “for of the three hundred and sixtydegrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by Ptolemy,the greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half whenwe come to the line I spoke of.”“By God,” said Sancho, “your worship gives me a nice authority for whatyou say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, or whatever it is.”Don Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon “computed,”and the name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he, “Thou must know,Sancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz for theEast Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they havepassed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die uponeverybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to befound in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so,Sancho, thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thoucomest upon anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, thenwe have crossed.”“I don’t believe a bit of it,” said Sancho; “still, I’ll do as yourworship bids me; though I don’t know what need there is for tryingthese experiments, for I can see with my own eyes that we have notmoved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from wherethe animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very sameplace where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear byall that’s good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant.”“Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and don’tmind any other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines,parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets,signs, bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrialspheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, orany portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels wehave cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations we have leftbehind and are now leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feel andhunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth whitepaper.”Sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to thehollow of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, “Eitherthe test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worshipsays, nor within many leagues of it.”“Why, how so?” asked Don Quixote; “hast thou come upon aught?”“Ay, and aughts,” replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed hiswhole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding inmidstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter,but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in themiddle of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out,“Seest thou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress,where there is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, orinfanta, or princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.”“What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talkingabout, señor?” said Sancho; “don’t you see that those are mills thatstand in the river to grind corn?”“Hold thy peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “though they look likemills they are not so; I have already told thee that enchantmentstransform things and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to saythey really change them from one form into another, but that it seemsas though they did, as experience proved in the transformation ofDulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.”By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, beganto move less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills,when they saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of beingsucked in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several ofthem, with long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces andgarments covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. Theyraised loud shouts, crying, “Devils of men, where are you going to? Areyou mad? Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to piecesamong these wheels?”“Did I not tell thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this, “that we hadreached the place where I am to show what the might of my arm can do?See what ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monstersoppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us! You shallsoon see, scoundrels!” And then standing up in the boat he began in aloud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, “Ill-conditionedand worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and freedom the personye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison, high or low or ofwhatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,otherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the dispositionof heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to thisadventure;” and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes inthe air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all thisnonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into therushing channel of the wheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutlyappealing to heaven to deliver him from such imminent peril; which itdid by the activity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing againstthe boat with their poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsettingand throwing Don Quixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it wasfor Don Quixote that he could swim like a goose, though the weight ofhis armour carried him twice to the bottom; and had it not been for themillers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out, it would have beenTroy town with the pair of them. As soon as, more drenched thanthirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his knees and withclasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and ferventprayer to God to deliver him evermore from the rash projects andattempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the boat, whichthe mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing itsmashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for itfrom Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing hadhappened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for thebark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, freeand unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castleof theirs.p29b.jpg (314K)Full Size“What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou forcarrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?”“That’s enough,” said Don Quixote to himself, “it would be preaching inthe desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do anyvirtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters must haveencountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts;one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us, thisworld is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with theother. I can do no more.” And then turning towards the mills he saidaloud, “Friends, whoe’er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgiveme that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from yourmisery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for someother knight.”So saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for theboat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying,“With a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk ourwhole capital.”The fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the twofigures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, andwere wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations andquestions Don Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusionthat they were madmen, they left them and betook themselves, themillers to their mills, and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixoteand Sancho returned to their beasts, and to their life of beasts, andso ended the adventure of the enchanted bark.p29e.jpg (54K)CHAPTER XXX.OF DON QUIXOTE’S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESSp30a.jpg (134K)Full SizeThey reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough, knightand squire, Sancho particularly, for with him what touched the stock ofmoney touched his heart, and when any was taken from him he felt as ifhe was robbed of the apples of his eyes. In fine, without exchanging aword, they mounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbedin thoughts of his love, Sancho in thinking of his advancement, whichjust then, it seemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, foolas he was, he saw clearly enough that his master’s acts were all ormost of them utterly senseless; and he began to cast about for anopportunity of retiring from his service and going home some day,without entering into any explanations or taking any farewell of him.Fortune, however, ordered matters after a fashion very much theopposite of what he contemplated.It so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of awood, Don Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far endof it observed some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was ahawking party. Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady ofgraceful mien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned withgreen trappings and a silver-mounted side-saddle. The lady was also ingreen, and so richly and splendidly dressed that splendour itselfseemed personified in her. On her left hand she bore a hawk, a proof toDon Quixote’s mind that she must be some great lady and the mistress ofthe whole hunting party, which was the fact; so he said to Sancho, “RunSancho, my son, and say to that lady on the palfrey with the hawk thatI, the Knight of the Lions, kiss the hands of her exalted beauty, andif her excellence will grant me leave I will go and kiss them in personand place myself at her service for aught that may be in my power andher highness may command; and mind, Sancho, how thou speakest, and takecare not to thrust in any of thy proverbs into thy message.”p30b.jpg (334K)Full Size“You’ve got a likely one here to thrust any in!” said Sancho; “leave mealone for that! Why, this is not the first time in my life I havecarried messages to high and exalted ladies.”“Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,” said Don Quixote,“I know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my service.”“That is true,” replied Sancho; “but pledges don’t distress a goodpayer, and in a house where there’s plenty supper is soon cooked; Imean there’s no need of telling or warning me about anything; for I’mready for everything and know a little of everything.”“That I believe, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “go and good luck to thee,and God speed thee.”Sancho went off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his regular pace,and came to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting kneltbefore her and said, “Fair lady, that knight that you see there, theKnight of the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his,and at home they call me Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions,who was called not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance,sends by me to say may it please your highness to give him leave that,with your permission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carryout his wishes, which are, as he says and I believe, to serve yourexalted loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will doa thing which will redound to your honour, and he will receive a mostdistinguished favour and happiness.”“You have indeed, squire,” said the lady, “delivered your message withall the formalities such messages require; rise up, for it is not rightthat the squire of a knight so great as he of the Rueful Countenance,of whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his knees;rise, my friend, and bid your master welcome to the services of myselfand the duke my husband, in a country house we have here.”Sancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by herhigh-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had saidabout having heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance;for if she did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt becausehe had so lately taken the name. “Tell me, brother squire,” asked theduchess (whose title, however, is not known), “this master of yours, ishe not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called ‘TheIngenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,’ who has for the lady ofhis heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?”“He is the same, señora,” replied Sancho; “and that squire of his whofigures, or ought to figure, in the said history under the name ofSancho Panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the cradle, Imean in the press.”“I am rejoiced at all this,” said the duchess; “go, brother Panza, andtell your master that he is welcome to my estate, and that nothingcould happen to me that could give me greater pleasure.”Sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifyinganswer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to theskies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, andher courtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixedhimself in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur,and with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess,who, having sent to summon the duke her husband, told him while DonQuixote was approaching all about the message; and as both of them hadread the First Part of this history, and from it were aware of DonQuixote’s crazy turn, they awaited him with the greatest delight andanxiety to make his acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humourand agree with everything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them,to treat him as a knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in thebooks of chivalry they had read, for they themselves were very fond ofthem.Don Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed aboutto dismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; butin getting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot inone of the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable tofree it, and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on theground. Don Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having thestirrup held, fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it forhim, threw himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante’s saddleafter him, which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he bothcame to the ground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant cursesmuttered between his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his footstill in the shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the helpof knight and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by hisfall; and he, limping, advanced as best he could to kneel before thenoble pair. This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on thecontrary, dismounting from his horse, he went and embraced Don Quixote,saying, “I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that yourfirst experience on my ground should have been such an unfortunate oneas we have seen; but the carelessness of squires is often the cause ofworse accidents.”“That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,” replied DonQuixote, “cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped shortof the depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen youwould have lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God’scurse upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talkingimpertinence than in tightening the girths of a saddle to keep itsteady; but however I may be, fallen or raised up, on foot or onhorseback, I shall always be at your service and that of my lady theduchess, your worthy consort, worthy queen of beauty and paramountprincess of courtesy.”“Gently, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,” said the duke; “where my ladyDoña Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that other beauties shouldbe praised.”Sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by,and before his master could answer he said, “There is no denying, andit must be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is verybeautiful; but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I haveheard say that what we call nature is like a potter that makes vesselsof clay, and he who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, orthree, or a hundred; I say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchessis in no way behind my mistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.”Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said, “Your highness may conceivethat never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or adroller squire than I have, and he will prove the truth of what I say,if your highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.”To which the duchess made answer, “that worthy Sancho is droll Iconsider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; fordrollery and sprightliness, Señor Don Quixote, as you very well know,do not take up their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is drolland sprightly I here set him down as shrewd.”“And talkative,” added Don Quixote.“So much the better,” said the duke, “for many droll things cannot besaid in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knightof the Rueful Countenance—”“Of the Lions, your highness must say,” said Sancho, “for there is noRueful Countenance nor any such character now.”“He of the Lions be it,” continued the duke; “I say, let Sir Knight ofthe Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be giventhat reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which theduchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.”By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante’s saddle, and DonQuixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, theyplaced the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. Theduchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infiniteenjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required nopressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thoughtit rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homelysquire in their castle.p30e.jpg (54K)CHAPTER XXXI.br/> WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERSp31a.jpg (155K)Full SizeSupreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as itseemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he lookedforward to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego’s houseand in Basilio’s; he was always fond of good living, and always seizedby the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever itpresented itself. The history informs us, then, that before theyreached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance andinstructed all his servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and sothe instant he came up to the castle gates with the duchess, twolackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of finecrimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching DonQuixote in their arms before he saw or heard them, said to him, “Yourhighness should go and take my lady the duchess off her horse.”p31b.jpg (334K)Full SizeDon Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed betweenthe two over the matter; but in the end the duchess’s determinationcarried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from herpalfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not considerherself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight.At length the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered aspacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over DonQuixote’s shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and atthe same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with themen-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, “Welcome,flower and cream of knight-errantry!” while all or most of them flungpellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke andduchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this wasthe first time that he thoroughly felt and believed himself to be aknight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he sawhimself treated in the same way as he had read of such knights beingtreated in days of yore.Sancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered thecastle, but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the assalone, he approached a respectable duenna who had come out with therest to receive the duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, “SeñoraGonzalez, or however your grace may be called—”“I am called Doña Rodriguez de Grijalba,” replied the duenna; “what isyour will, brother?” To which Sancho made answer, “I should be glad ifyour worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate, whereyou will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him inthe stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor little beast israther easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all.”“If the master is as wise as the man,” said the duenna, “we have got afine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him whobrought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of thishouse, are not used to work of that sort.”“Well then, in troth,” returned Sancho, “I have heard my master, who isthe very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of Lancelot whenhe came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him and duennas uponhis hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn’t change him for SeñorLancelot’s hack.”“If you are a jester, brother,” said the duenna, “keep your drolleriesfor some place where they’ll pass muster and be paid for; for you’llget nothing from me but a fig.”“At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,” said Sancho, “for you won’tlose the trick in years by a point too little.”“Son of a bitch,” said the duenna, all aglow with anger, “whether I’mold or not, it’s with God I have to reckon, not with you, yougarlic-stuffed scoundrel!” and she said it so loud, that the duchessheard it, and turning round and seeing the duenna in such a state ofexcitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she was wrangling with.“With this good fellow here,” said the duenna, “who has particularlyrequested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the castle gateinto the stable, holding it up to me as an example that they did thesame I don’t know where—that some ladies waited on one Lancelot, andduennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up with, he called meold.”“That,” said the duchess, “I should have considered the greatestaffront that could be offered me;” and addressing Sancho, she said tohim, “You must know, friend Sancho, that Doña Rodriguez is veryyouthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority and custom’ssake than because of her years.”“May all the rest of mine be unlucky,” said Sancho, “if I meant it thatway; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great,and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted personthan the lady Doña Rodriguez.”Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him, “Is this properconversation for the place, Sancho?”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “every one must mention what he wants whereverhe may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I hadthought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.”On which the duke observed, “Sancho is quite right, and there is noreason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to hisheart’s content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated likehimself.”While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, wasproceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into achamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relievedhim of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them preparedand instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, andhow they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believethey were treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour wasremoved, there stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches andchamois doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to bekissing each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waitingon him had not taken care to check their merriment (which was one ofthe particular directions their master and mistress had given them),they would have burst with laughter. They asked him to let himself bestripped that they might put a shirt on him, but he would not on anyaccount, saying that modesty became knights-errant just as much asvalour. However, he said they might give the shirt to Sancho; andshutting himself in with him in a room where there was a sumptuous bed,he undressed and put on the shirt; and then, finding himself alone withSancho, he said to him, “Tell me, thou new-fledged buffoon and oldbooby, dost thou think it right to offend and insult a duenna sodeserving of reverence and respect as that one just now? Was that atime to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble personageslikely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their owners insuch elegant style? For God’s sake, Sancho, restrain thyself, and don’tshow the thread so as to let them see what a coarse, boorish texturethou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the master is the moreesteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are; and thatone of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men is thatthey have servants as good as themselves to wait on them. Dost thou notsee—shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal that Iam!—that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dullblockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler? Nay,nay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of thesestumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterboxand droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips;bridle thy tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thymouth, and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God’s help,and the strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced infame and fortune.”Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, andto bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogetherto the purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mindeasy on that point, for it should never be discovered through him whatthey were.Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threwthe scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera ofgreen satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed outinto the large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in doublefile, the same number on each side, all with the appliances for washingthe hands, which they presented to him with profuse obeisances andceremonies. Then came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, tolead him to dinner, as his hosts were already waiting for him. Theyplaced him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and statelinessthey conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous tablelaid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to thedoor of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic,one of those who rule noblemen’s houses; one of those who, not beingborn magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how tobehave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folkmeasured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when theytry to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it intomeanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchmanwho came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote.A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, takingDon Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The dukepressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though herefused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had toaccept it.The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke andduchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping withamazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustriouspersons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passedbetween the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at thehead of the table, he said, “If your worship will give me leave I willtell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter ofseats.”The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that hewas about to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessinghis thoughts, said, “Don’t be afraid of my going astray, señor, orsaying anything that won’t be pat to the purpose; I haven’t forgottenthe advice your worship gave me just now about talking much or little,well or ill.”“I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “saywhat thou wilt, only say it quickly.”“Well then,” said Sancho, “what I am going to say is so true that mymaster Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me from lying.”“Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“for I am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou art going tosay.”“I have so considered and reconsidered,” said Sancho, “that thebell-ringer’s in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.”“It would be well,” said Don Quixote, “if your highnesses would orderthem to turn out this idiot, for he will talk a heap of nonsense.”“By the life of the duke, Sancho shall not be taken away from me for amoment,” said the duchess; “I am very fond of him, for I know he isvery discreet.”“Discreet be the days of your holiness,” said Sancho, “for the goodopinion you have of my wit, though there’s none in me; but the story Iwant to tell is this. There was an invitation given by a gentleman ofmy town, a very rich one, and one of quality, for he was one of theAlamos of Medina del Campo, and married to Doña Mencia de Quiñones, thedaughter of Don Alonso de Marañon, Knight of the Order of Santiago,that was drowned at the Herradura—him there was that quarrel aboutyears ago in our village, that my master Don Quixote was mixed up in,to the best of my belief, that Tomasillo the scapegrace, the son ofBalbastro the smith, was wounded in.—Isn’t all this true, master mine?As you live, say so, that these gentlefolk may not take me for somelying chatterer.”“So far,” said the ecclesiastic, “I take you to be more a chattererthan a liar; but I don’t know what I shall take you for by-and-by.”“Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“that I have no choice but to say thou must be telling the truth; goon, and cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not to make anend for two days to come.”“He is not to cut it short,” said the duchess; “on the contrary, for mygratification, he is to tell it as he knows it, though he should notfinish it these six days; and if he took so many they would be to methe pleasantest I ever spent.”“Well then, sirs, I say,” continued Sancho, “that this same gentleman,whom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it’s not a bowshot frommy house to his, invited a poor but respectable labourer—”“Get on, brother,” said the churchman; “at the rate you are going youwill not stop with your story short of the next world.”“I’ll stop less than half-way, please God,” said Sancho; “and so I saythis labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman I spoke of thatinvited him—rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by token he diedthe death of an angel, so they say; for I was not there, for just atthat time I had gone to reap at Tembleque—”“As you live, my son,” said the churchman, “make haste back fromTembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman, unlessyou want to make more funerals.”“Well then, it so happened,” said Sancho, “that as the pair of themwere going to sit down to table—and I think I can see them now plainerthan ever—”Great was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from theirritation the worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting waySancho had of telling his story, while Don Quixote was chafing withrage and vexation.“So, as I was saying,” continued Sancho, “as the pair of them weregoing to sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insisted upon thegentleman’s taking the head of the table, and the gentleman insistedupon the labourer’s taking it, as his orders should be obeyed in hishouse; but the labourer, who plumed himself on his politeness and goodbreeding, would not on any account, until the gentleman, out ofpatience, putting his hands on his shoulders, compelled him by force tosit down, saying, ‘Sit down, you stupid lout, for wherever I sit willbe the head to you; and that’s the story, and, troth, I think it hasn’tbeen brought in amiss here.”Don Quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled ittill it looked like jasper. The duke and duchess suppressed theirlaughter so as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they sawthrough Sancho’s impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keepSancho from uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixotewhat news he had of the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her anypresents of giants or miscreants lately, for he could not but havevanquished a good many.To which Don Quixote replied, “Señora, my misfortunes, though they hada beginning, will never have an end. I have vanquished giants and Ihave sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find herif she is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wenchthat can be imagined?”“I don’t know,” said Sancho Panza; “to me she seems the fairestcreature in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and jumping she won’tgive in to a tumbler; by my faith, señora duchess, she leaps from theground on to the back of an ass like a cat.”“Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho?” asked the duke.“What, seen her!” said Sancho; “why, who the devil was it but myselfthat first thought of the enchantment business? She is as muchenchanted as my father.”The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs andenchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of LaMancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himselfoften reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read suchfooleries; and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct,addressing the duke, he said very angrily to him, “Señor, yourexcellence will have to give account to God for what this good mandoes. This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is,cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would havehim, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries andfollies.” Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, “And you,num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, andvanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour,and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up yourchildren if you have any, and attend to your business, and give overgoing wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock ofyourself to all who know you and all who don’t. Where, in heaven’sname, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant?Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, orenchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tellabout you?”Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman’s words, andas soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of thepresence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angrylooks and an agitated countenance, and said—But the reply deserves achapter to itself.p31e.jpg (46K)CHAPTER XXXII.OF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS CENSURER, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVEAND DROLLp32a.jpg (152K)Full SizeDon Quixote, then, having risen to his feet, trembling from head tofoot like a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice,“The place I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect Ihave and always have had for the profession to which your worshipbelongs, hold and bind the hands of my just indignation; and as wellfor these reasons as because I know, as everyone knows, that agownsman’s weapon is the same as a woman’s, the tongue, I will withmine engage in equal combat with your worship, from whom one might haveexpected good advice instead of foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproofrequires a different demeanour and arguments of another sort; at anyrate, to have reproved me in public, and so roughly, exceeds the boundsof proper reproof, for that comes better with gentleness than withrudeness; and it is not seemly to call the sinner roundly blockhead andbooby, without knowing anything of the sin that is reproved. Come, tellme, for which of the stupidities you have observed in me do you condemnand abuse me, and bid me go home and look after my house and wife andchildren, without knowing whether I have any? Is nothing more neededthan to get a footing, by hook or by crook, in other people’s houses torule over the masters (and that, perhaps, after having been brought upin all the straitness of some seminary, and without having ever seenmore of the world than may lie within twenty or thirty leagues round),to fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry, and pass judgmenton knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or is the timeill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of itsenjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwardsto the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles,men of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as anirreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have neverentered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish.Knight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the MostHigh. Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that ofmean and servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and somethat of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path ofknight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, butnot honour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punishedinsolences, vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, forno other reason than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so;but though I am, I am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste,platonic sort. My intentions are always directed to worthy ends, to dogood to all and evil to none; and if he who means this, does this, andmakes this his practice deserves to be called a fool, it is for yourhighnesses to say, O most excellent duke and duchess.”“Good, by God!” cried Sancho; “say no more in your own defence, mastermine, for there’s nothing more in the world to be said, thought, orinsisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as he has, thatthere are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world, is it anywonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?”“Perhaps, brother,” said the ecclesiastic, “you are that Sancho Panzathat is mentioned, to whom your master has promised an island?”“Yes, I am,” said Sancho, “and what’s more, I am one who deserves it asmuch as anyone; I am one of the sort—‘Attach thyself to the good, andthou wilt be one of them,’ and of those, ‘Not with whom thou art bred,but with whom thou art fed,’ and of those, ‘Who leans against a goodtree, a good shade covers him;’ I have leant upon a good master, and Ihave been for months going about with him, and please God I shall bejust such another; long life to him and long life to me, for neitherwill he be in any want of empires to rule, or I of islands to govern.”“No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,” said the duke, “for in the nameof Señor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one of nosmall importance that I have at my disposal.”“Go down on thy knees, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and kiss the feet ofhis excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee.”Sancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from tablecompletely out of temper, exclaiming, “By the gown I wear, I am almostinclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as thesesinners. No wonder they are mad, when people who are in their sensessanction their madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so longas they are in the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself thetrouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;” and without utteringanother word, or eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties ofthe duke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not thatthe duke said much to him, for he could not, because of the laughterhis uncalled-for anger provoked.When he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, “You have replied onyour own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is nooccasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it maylook like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give nooffence, no more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and the reason is, that he who isnot liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women, children,and ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they mayreceive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and theinsult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference:the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so,and maintains it; the offence may come from any quarter withoutcarrying insult. To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectinglyin the street and ten others come up armed and beat him; he draws hissword and quits himself like a man, but the number of his antagonistsmakes it impossible for him to effect his purpose and avenge himself;this man suffers an offence but not an insult. Another example willmake the same thing plain: a man is standing with his back turned,another comes up and strikes him, and after striking him takes toflight, without waiting an instant, and the other pursues him but doesnot overtake him; he who received the blow received an offence, but notan insult, because an insult must be maintained. If he who struck him,though he did so sneakingly and treacherously, had drawn his sword andstood and faced him, then he who had been struck would have receivedoffence and insult at the same time; offence because he was strucktreacherously, insult because he who struck him maintained what he haddone, standing his ground without taking to flight. And so, accordingto the laws of the accursed duel, I may have received offence, but notinsult, for neither women nor children can maintain it, nor can theywound, nor have they any way of standing their ground, and it is justthe same with those connected with religion; for these three sorts ofpersons are without arms offensive or defensive, and so, thoughnaturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no right tooffend anybody; and though I said just now I might have receivedoffence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insultcan still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor doI feel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he hadstayed a little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake hemakes in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never havebeen any knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of hiscountless descendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would nothave gone well with his worship.”“I will take my oath of that,” said Sancho; “they would have given hima slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like apomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up withjokes of that sort! By my faith, I’m certain if Reinaldos of Montalvanhad heard the little man’s words he would have given him such a spankon the mouth that he wouldn’t have spoken for the next three years; ay,let him tackle them, and he’ll see how he’ll get out of their hands!”The duchess, as she listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter,and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than hismaster; and there were a good many just then who were of the sameopinion.Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as thecloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silverbasin, another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine whitetowels on her shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to theelbows, and in her white hands (for white they certainly were) a roundball of Naples soap. The one with the basin approached, and with archcomposure and impudence, thrust it under Don Quixote’s chin, who,wondering at such a ceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be thecustom of that country to wash beards instead of hands; he thereforestretched his out as far as he could, and at the same instant the jugbegan to pour and the damsel with the soap rubbed his beard briskly,raising snow-flakes, for the soap lather was no less white, not onlyover the beard, but all over the face, and over the eyes of thesubmissive knight, so that they were perforce obliged to keep shut. Theduke and duchess, who had not known anything about this, waited to seewhat came of this strange washing. The barber damsel, when she had hima hand’s breadth deep in lather, pretended that there was no morewater, and bade the one with the jug go and fetch some, while Señor DonQuixote waited. She did so, and Don Quixote was left the strangest andmost ludicrous figure that could be imagined. All those present, andthere were a good many, were watching him, and as they saw him therewith half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his eyes shut, andhis beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by greatdiscretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter. Thedamsels, the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daringto look at their master and mistress; and as for them, laughter andanger struggled within them, and they knew not what to do, whether topunish the audacity of the girls, or to reward them for the amusementthey had received from seeing Don Quixote in such a plight.At length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end ofwashing Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels verydeliberately wiped him and dried him; and all four together making hima profound obeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke,lest Don Quixote should see through the joke, called out to the onewith the basin saying, “Come and wash me, and take care that there iswater enough.” The girl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed thebasin for the duke as she had done for Don Quixote, and they soon hadhim well soaped and washed, and having wiped him dry they made theirobeisance and retired. It appeared afterwards that the duke had swornthat if they had not washed him as they had Don Quixote he would havepunished them for their impudence, which they adroitly atoned for bysoaping him as well.Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and saidto himself, “God bless me, if it were only the custom in this countryto wash squires’ beards too as well as knights’. For by God and upon mysoul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besidesI’d take it as a still greater kindness.”“What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?” asked the duchess.“I was saying, señora,” he replied, “that in the courts of otherprinces, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say theygive water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows itis good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say toothat he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergoa washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.”“Don’t be uneasy, friend Sancho,” said the duchess; “I will take carethat my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.”“I’ll be content with the beard,” said Sancho, “at any rate for thepresent; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.”“Attend to worthy Sancho’s request, seneschal,” said the duchess, “anddo exactly what he wishes.”The seneschal replied that Señor Sancho should be obeyed in everything;and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him,while the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussinga great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms andknight-errantry.The duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentivememory, to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of thelady Dulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad ofher beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in theworld, nay, in all La Mancha.Don Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess’s request, and said, “If Icould pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table herebefore your highness’s eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain oftelling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence wouldsee her portrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict anddescribe in detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerlessDulcinea, the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, anenterprise wherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles,and the graver of Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it inpictures and carve it in marble and bronze, and Ciceronian andDemosthenian eloquence to sound its praises?”“What does Demosthenian mean, Señor Don Quixote?” said the duchess; “itis a word I never heard in all my life.”“Demosthenian eloquence,” said Don Quixote, “means the eloquence ofDemosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the two mosteloquent orators in the world.”“True,” said the duke; “you must have lost your wits to ask such aquestion. Nevertheless, Señor Don Quixote would greatly gratify us ifhe would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketchshe will be something to make the fairest envious.”“I would do so certainly,” said Don Quixote, “had she not been blurredto my mind’s eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short timesince, one of such a nature that I am more ready to weep over it thanto describe it. For your highnesses must know that, going a few daysback to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, andpermission for this third sally, I found her altogether a differentbeing from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from aprincess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil,from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from adignified lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea delToboso into a coarse Sayago wench.”“God bless me!” said the duke aloud at this, “who can have done theworld such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty thatgladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modestythat shed a lustre upon it?”“Who?” replied Don Quixote; “who could it be but some malignantenchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy—that accursed raceborn into the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements ofthe good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchantershave persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters willcontinue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalryin the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where theyknow I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is todeprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light,of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it, and Isay it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a treewithout leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow withoutthe body that causes it.”“There is no denying it,” said the duchess; “but still, if we are tobelieve the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately withgeneral applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, thatyou never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing inthe world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gavebirth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms andperfections you chose.”“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don Quixote; “Godknows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether sheis imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which mustnot be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begotten nor given birthto my lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, a lady whocontains in herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout theworld, beautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tenderand yet modest, gracious from courtesy and courteous from goodbreeding, and lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines forthand excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood than inthe fair of lowly birth.”“That is true,” said the duke; “but Señor Don Quixote will give meleave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of his exploitsthat I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting thereis a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in thehighest degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regardsthe loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas,Alastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as youwell know, the histories abound.”“To that I may reply,” said Don Quixote, “that Dulcinea is the daughterof her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtueis more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice. Dulcinea,besides, has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned andsceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capableof performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, shehas in herself higher fortunes.”“I protest, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that in all you say,you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth Iwill believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my housebelieves, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a Dulcineain El Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautifuland nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Señor Don Quixotein her service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my powerto give her or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining adoubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt isthis, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza,when he carried a letter on your worship’s behalf to the said ladyDulcinea, found her sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it saysit was red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of herlineage.”To this Don Quixote made answer, “Señora, your highness must know thateverything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinarylimits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be that itis directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice ofsome jealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or mostfamous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proofagainst enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerableflesh that he cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of thetwelve peers of France, of whom it is related that he could not bewounded except in the sole of his left foot, and that it must be withthe point of a stout pin and not with any other sort of weaponwhatever; and so, when Bernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles,finding that he could not wound him with steel, he lifted him up fromthe ground in his arms and strangled him, calling to mind seasonablythe death which Hercules inflicted on Antæus, the fierce giant thatthey say was the son of Terra. I would infer from what I have mentionedthat perhaps I may have some gift of this kind, not that of beinginvulnerable, because experience has many times proved to me that I amof tender flesh and not at all impenetrable; nor that of being proofagainst enchantment, for I have already seen myself thrust into a cage,in which all the world would not have been able to confine me except byforce of enchantments. But as I delivered myself from that one, I aminclined to believe that there is no other that can hurt me; and so,these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert their vile craftagainst my person, revenge themselves on what I love most, and seek torob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; andtherefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her,they changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a meanoccupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that thatwheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl.And as a proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming toEl Toboso a short time back, I was altogether unable to discover thepalace of Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire,saw her in her own proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, tome she appeared to be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by nomeans a well-spoken one, she who is propriety itself. And so, as I amnot and, so far as one can judge, cannot be enchanted, she it is thatis enchanted, that is smitten, that is altered, changed, andtransformed; in her have my enemies revenged themselves upon me, andfor her shall I live in ceaseless tears, until I see her in herpristine state. I have mentioned this lest anybody should mind whatSancho said about Dulcinea’s winnowing or sifting; for, as they changedher to me, it is no wonder if they changed her to him. Dulcinea isillustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle families of ElToboso, which are many, ancient, and good. Therein, most assuredly, notsmall is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her town willbe famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen,and Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition.For another thing; I would have your graces understand that SanchoPanza is one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant;sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute that it is anamusement to try and make out whether he is simple or sharp; he hasmischievous tricks that stamp him rogue, and blundering ways that provehim a booby; he doubts everything and believes everything; when I fancyhe is on the point of coming down headlong from sheer stupidity, hecomes out with something shrewd that sends him up to the skies. Afterall, I would not exchange him for another squire, though I were given acity to boot, and therefore I am in doubt whether it will be well tosend him to the government your highness has bestowed upon him; thoughI perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of governing, sothat, with a little trimming of his understanding, he would manage anygovernment as easily as the king does his taxes; and moreover, we knowalready ample experience that it does not require much cleverness ormuch learning to be a governor, for there are a hundred round about usthat scarcely know how to read, and govern like gerfalcons. The mainpoint is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doingright in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons toadvise and direct them in what they have to do, like thoseknight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with theaid of an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe andsurrender no right, and I have some other little matters in reserve,that shall be produced in due season for Sancho’s benefit and theadvantage of the island he is to govern.”The duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in theirconversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace,and Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with astraining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whomcarried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impuritywas plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followedhim everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence tothrust it under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious towash his beard.“What is all this, brothers?” asked the duchess. “What is it? What doyou want to do to this good man? Do you forget he is a governor-elect?”To which the barber kitchen-boy replied, “The gentleman will not lethimself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the señor hismaster have been.”“Yes, I will,” said Sancho, in a great rage; “but I’d like it to bewith cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands; for there’snot so much difference between me and my master that he should bewashed with angels’ water and I with devil’s lye. The customs ofcountries and princes’ palaces are only good so long as they give noannoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worse than doingpenance. I have a clean beard, and I don’t require to be refreshed inthat fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head,I mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I’ll give hima punch that will leave my fist sunk in his skull; for cirimonies andsoapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentions ofone’s host.”The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho’s rageand heard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see himin such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and thehangers-on of the kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to theduke and duchess, as if to ask their permission to speak, he addressedthe rout in a dignified tone: “Holloa, gentlemen! you let that youthalone, and go back to where you came from, or anywhere else if youlike; my squire is as clean as any other person, and those troughs areas bad as narrow thin-necked jars to him; take my advice and leave himalone, for neither he nor I understand joking.”Sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, “Nay, let them comeand try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it’s about as likelyI’ll stand them as that it’s now midnight! Let them bring me a combhere, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if theyget anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clipme to the skin.”Upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, “Sancho Panza isright, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he sayshimself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do notplease him, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanlinesshave been excessively careless and thoughtless, I don’t know if I oughtnot to say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchendishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels ofholland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you areill-conditioned and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot helpshowing the grudge you have against the squires of knights-errant.”The impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, tookthe duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed thestraining-cloth from Sancho’s neck, and with something like shame andconfusion of face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he,seeing himself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him,ran and fell on his knees before the duchess, saying, “From greatladies great favours may be looked for; this which your grace has doneme to-day cannot be requited with less than wishing I was dubbed aknight-errant, to devote myself all the days of my life to the serviceof so exalted a lady. I am a labouring man, my name is Sancho Panza, Iam married, I have children, and I am serving as a squire; if in anyone of these ways I can serve your highness, I will not be longer inobeying than your grace in commanding.”“It is easy to see, Sancho,” replied the duchess, “that you havelearned to be polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean to sayit is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Señor DonQuixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower ofceremony—or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the fortunesof such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure ofknight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho,my friend; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord theduke makes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon aspossible.”With this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired totake his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had avery great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon withher and her damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, thoughhe certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heatof the day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all hismight not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come inobedience to her command, and with that he went off. The duke gavefresh orders with respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant,without departing even in smallest particular from the style in which,as the stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old.p32e.jpg (16K)CHAPTER XXXIII.OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITHSANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTINGp33a.jpg (138K)Full SizeThe history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but inorder to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visitthe duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sitdown beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure goodbreeding, wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he wasto sit down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he wasworthy of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sanchoshrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess’sdamsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence tohear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first,saying:“Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, Ishould be glad if the señor governor would relieve me of certain doubtsI have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is nowin print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I meanthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote’s letter to her, forit was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did hedare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat,the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to theprejudice of the peerless Dulcinea’s good name, a thing that is not atall becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?”p33b.jpg (326K)Full SizeAt these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from hischair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger onhis lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and thisdone, he came back to his seat and said, “Now, señora, that I have seenthat there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly,I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, withoutfear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for myown part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimeshe says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody’s that listens tohim, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himselfcould not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyondall question, it’s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this isclear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that haveneither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter,and that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history,that is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; forI made him believe she is enchanted, though there’s no more truth in itthan over the hills of Úbeda.”The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception,so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and hishearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchesssaid, “In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt startsup in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says,‘If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squireknows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goestrusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be stillmadder and sillier than his master; and that being so, it will be castin your teeth, señora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island togovern; for how will he who does not know how to govern himself knowhow to govern others?’”“By God, señora,” said Sancho, “but that doubt comes timely; but yourgrace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I knowwhat you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my masterlong ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can’t help it,I must follow him; we’re from the same village, I’ve eaten his bread,I’m fond of him, I’m grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above allI’m faithful; so it’s quite impossible for anything to separate us,except the pickaxe and shovel. And if your highness does not like togive me the government you promised, God made me without it, and maybeyour not giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience, forfool as I am I know the proverb ‘to her hurt the ant got wings,’ and itmay be that Sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho thegovernor. ‘They make as good bread here as in France,’ and ‘by nightall cats are grey,’ and ‘a hard case enough his, who hasn’t broken hisfast at two in the afternoon,’ and ‘there’s no stomach a hand’s breadthbigger than another,’ and the same can be filled ‘with straw or hay,’as the saying is, and ‘the little birds of the field have God for theirpurveyor and caterer,’ and ‘four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmerthan four of Segovia broad-cloth,’ and ‘when we quit this world and areput underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as thejourneyman,’ and ‘the Pope’s body does not take up more feet of earththan the sacristan’s,’ for all that the one is higher than the other;for when we go to our graves we all pack ourselves up and makeourselves small, or rather they pack us up and make us small in spiteof us, and then—good night to us. And I say once more, if your ladyshipdoes not like to give me the island because I’m a fool, like a wise manI will take care to give myself no trouble about it; I have heard saythat ‘behind the cross there’s the devil,’ and that ‘all that glittersis not gold,’ and that from among the oxen, and the ploughs, and theyokes, Wamba the husbandman was taken to be made King of Spain, andfrom among brocades, and pleasures, and riches, Roderick was taken tobe devoured by adders, if the verses of the old ballads don’t lie.”“To be sure they don’t lie!” exclaimed Doña Rodriguez, the duenna, whowas one of the listeners. “Why, there’s a ballad that says they putKing Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards,and that two days afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice,cried out from within the tomb-They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now,There where I most did sin.And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he wouldrather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.”The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, orwondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said,“Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made apromise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. Mylord and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is nonethe less a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about thepromised island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. LetSancho be of good cheer; for when he least expects it he will findhimself seated on the throne of his island and seat of dignity, andwill take possession of his government that he may discard it foranother of three-bordered brocade. The charge I give him is to becareful how he governs his vassals, bearing in mind that they are allloyal and well-born.”“As to governing them well,” said Sancho, “there’s no need of chargingme to do that, for I’m kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassionfor the poor; there’s no stealing the loaf from him who kneads andbakes;’ and by my faith it won’t do to throw false dice with me; I aman old dog, and I know all about ‘tus, tus;’ I can be wide-awake ifneed be, and I don’t let clouds come before my eyes, for I know wherethe shoe pinches me; I say so, because with me the good will havesupport and protection, and the bad neither footing nor access. And itseems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything;and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I’ll take kindly tothe work and know more about it than the field labour I have beenbrought up to.”“You are right, Sancho,” said the duchess, “for no one is born readytaught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. Butto return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantmentof the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something morethan evident, that Sancho’s idea of practising a deception upon hismaster, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and thatif he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, wasall a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. Forin truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarsecountry wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso,and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is theone that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt thetruth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Señor Sancho Panzamust know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed tous, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly,without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agilecountry lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchantedas the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall seeher in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of theerror he is under at present.”“All that’s very possible,” said Sancho Panza; “and now I’m willing tobelieve what my master says about what he saw in the cave ofMontesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in thevery same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when Ienchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the otherway, as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose thatout of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment,nor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeblepersuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason.But, señora, your excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed,for a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thoughts and plots ofthose vile enchanters. I invented all that to escape my master’sscolding, and not with any intention of hurting him; and if it hasturned out differently, there is a God in heaven who judges ourhearts.”“That is true,” said the duchess; “but tell me, Sancho, what is thisyou say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to know.”Sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been saidalready touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said,“From this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixotesays he saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from ElToboso, it is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very activeand exceedingly busy enchanters about.”“So I say,” said Sancho, “and if my lady Dulcinea is enchanted, so muchthe worse for her, and I’m not going to pick a quarrel with my master’senemies, who seem to be many and spiteful. The truth is that the one Isaw was a country wench, and I set her down to be a country wench; andif that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should I becalled to answer for it or take the consequences. But they must gonagging at me at every step—‘Sancho said it, Sancho did it, Sanchohere, Sancho there,’ as if Sancho was nobody at all, and not that sameSancho Panza that’s now going all over the world in books, so SamsonCarrasco told me, and he’s at any rate one that’s a bachelor ofSalamanca; and people of that sort can’t lie, except when the whimseizes them or they have some very good reason for it. So there’s nooccasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and then I have a goodcharacter, and, as I have heard my master say, ‘a good name is betterthan great riches;’ let them only stick me into this government andthey’ll see wonders, for one who has been a good squire will be a goodgovernor.”“All worthy Sancho’s observations,” said the duchess, “are Catoniansentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of Michael Verinohimself, who _florentibus occidit annis_. In fact, to speak in his ownstyle, ‘under a bad cloak there’s often a good drinker.’”“Indeed, señora,” said Sancho, “I never yet drank out of wickedness;from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the hypocrite inme; I drink when I’m inclined, or, if I’m not inclined, when they offerit to me, so as not to look either strait-laced or ill-bred; for when afriend drinks one’s health what heart can be so hard as not to returnit? But if I put on my shoes I don’t dirty them; besides, squires toknights-errant mostly drink water, for they are always wandering amongwoods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags, without a drop of wineto be had if they gave their eyes for it.”“So I believe,” said the duchess; “and now let Sancho go and take hissleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and settle how hemay soon go and stick himself into the government, as he says.”Sancho once more kissed the duchess’s hand, and entreated her to letgood care be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.“What is Dapple?” said the duchess.“My ass,” said Sancho, “which, not to mention him by that name, I’maccustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take careof him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I hadsaid she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and properfor duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! whata spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!”“He must have been some clown,” said Doña Rodriguez the duenna; “for ifhe had been a gentleman and well-born he would have exalted them higherthan the horns of the moon.”“That will do,” said the duchess; “no more of this; hush, DoñaRodriguez, and let Señor Panza rest easy and leave the treatment ofDapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho’s, I’ll put himon the apple of my eye.”“It will be enough for him to be in the stable,” said Sancho, “forneither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of yourhighness’s eye, and I’d as soon stab myself as consent to it; forthough my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a cardtoo many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses wemust mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.”“Take him to your government, Sancho,” said the duchess, “and there youwill be able to make as much of him as you like, and even release himfrom work and pension him off.”“Don’t think, señora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,” saidSancho; “I have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for meto take mine with me would be nothing new.”Sancho’s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her freshamusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the dukethe conversation she had had with him, and between them they plottedand arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare oneand entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style theypractised several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that theyform the best adventures this great history contains.p33e.jpg (34K)CHAPTER XXXIV.WHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANTTHE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURESIN THIS BOOKp34a.jpg (141K)Full SizeGreat was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation ofDon Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the planthey had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the lookand appearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action whatDon Quixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, inorder to play him a famous one. But what the duchess marvelled at aboveall was that Sancho’s simplicity could be so great as to make himbelieve as absolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it washe himself who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business.Having, therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were todo, six days afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great aretinue of huntsmen and beaters as a crowned king.They presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with anotherof the finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his on,saying that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and couldnot carry wardrobes or stores with him. Sancho, however, took what theygave him, meaning to sell it at the first opportunity.The appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sanchoarrayed himself, and mounted on his Dapple (for he would not give himup though they offered him a horse), he placed himself in the midst ofthe troop of huntsmen. The duchess came out splendidly attired, and DonQuixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her palfrey,though the duke wanted not to allow him; and at last they reached awood that lay between two high mountains, where, after occupyingvarious posts, ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party indifferent positions, the hunt began with great noise, shouting, andhallooing, so that, between the baying of the hounds and the blowing ofthe horns, they could not hear one another. The duchess dismounted, andwith a sharp boar-spear in her hand posted herself where she knew thewild boars were in the habit of passing. The duke and Don Quixotelikewise dismounted and placed themselves one at each side of her.Sancho took up a position in the rear of all without dismounting fromDapple, whom he dared not desert lest some mischief should befall him.Scarcely had they taken their stand in a line with several of theirservants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressed by the hounds andfollowed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grinding his teeth andtusks, and scattering foam from his mouth. As soon as he saw him DonQuixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword, advancedto meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the duchesswould have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevented her.Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, tookto his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a talloak. As he was clinging to a branch, however, half-way up in hisstruggle to reach the top, the bough, such was his ill-luck and hardfate, gave way, and caught in his fall by a broken limb of the oak, hehung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground. Finding himselfin this position, and that the green coat was beginning to tear, andreflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might be able toget at him, he began to utter such cries, and call for help soearnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he mustbe in the teeth of some wild beast. In the end the tusked boar fellpierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him; andDon Quixote, turning round at the cries of Sancho, for he knew by themthat it was he, saw him hanging from the oak head downwards, withDapple, who did not forsake him in his distress, close beside him; andCide Hamete observes that he seldom saw Sancho Panza without seeingDapple, or Dapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such was theirattachment and loyalty one to the other. Don Quixote went over andunhooked Sancho, who, as soon as he found himself on the ground, lookedat the rent in his huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart, for hethought he had got a patrimonial estate in that suit.Meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, andhaving covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, theybore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents whichhad been pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tableslaid and dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it waseasy to see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it.Sancho, as he showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess,observed, “If we had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coatwould have been safe from being in the plight it’s in; I don’t knowwhat pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may takeyour life with his tusk if he gets at you. I recollect having heard anold ballad sung that says,By bears be thou devoured, as erstWas famous Favila.”“That,” said Don Quixote, “was a Gothic king, who, going a-hunting, wasdevoured by a bear.”“Just so,” said Sancho; “and I would not have kings and princes exposethemselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which, to mymind, ought not to be one, as it consists in killing an animal that hasdone no harm whatever.”“Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,” said the duke; “forhunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than foranybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems, wiles,and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it extremecold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and sleep aredespised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him whoengages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit whichmay be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many;and the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports ofother sorts are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and greatlords. Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you aregovernor take to hunting, and you will find the good of it.”“Nay,” said Sancho, “the good governor should have a broken leg andkeep at home;” it would be a nice thing if, after people had been atthe trouble of coming to look for him on business, the governor were tobe away in the forest enjoying himself; the government would go onbadly in that fashion. By my faith, señor, hunting and amusements aremore fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend to amuse myselfwith is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays andholidays; for these huntings don’t suit my condition or agree with myconscience.”“God grant it may turn out so,” said the duke; “because it’s a longstep from saying to doing.”“Be that as it may,” said Sancho, “‘pledges don’t distress a goodpayer,’ and ‘he whom God helps does better than he who gets up early,’and ‘it’s the tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;’I mean to say that if God gives me help and I do my duty honestly, nodoubt I’ll govern better than a gerfalcon. Nay, let them only put afinger in my mouth, and they’ll see whether I can bite or not.”“The curse of God and all his saints upon thee, thou accursed Sancho!”exclaimed Don Quixote; “when will the day come—as I have often said tothee—when I shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remarkwithout proverbs? Pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for hewill grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousandproverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to the purposeas—may God grant as much health to him, or to me if I want to listen tothem!”“Sancho Panza’s proverbs,” said the duchess, “though more in numberthan the Greek Commander’s, are not therefore less to be esteemed forthe conciseness of the maxims. For my own part, I can say they give memore pleasure than others that may be better brought in and moreseasonably introduced.”In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent intothe wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts andhiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantlyor tranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it wasthen midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aidedthe project of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall,and a little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all foursides seemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on allsides, a vast number of trumpets and other military instruments wereheard, as if several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood.The blaze of the fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almostblinded the eyes and deafened the ears of those that stood by, andindeed of all who were in the wood. Then there were heard repeatedlelilies after the fashion of the Moors when they rush to battle;trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat, fifes played, so unceasinglyand so fast that he could not have had any senses who did not lose themwith the confused din of so many instruments. The duke was astounded,the duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, Sancho Panza trembling, andindeed, even they who were aware of the cause were frightened. In theirfear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion, in the guise of ademon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of a bugle, a hugehollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note.“Ho there! brother courier,” cried the duke, “who are you? Where areyou going? What troops are these that seem to be passing through thewood?”To which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, “I am thedevil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who are comingthis way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphalcar the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under enchantment,together with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions toDon Quixote as to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted.”“If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,”said the duke, “you would have known the said knight Don Quixote of LaMancha, for you have him here before you.”“By God and upon my conscience,” said the devil, “I never observed it,for my mind is occupied with so many different things that I wasforgetting the main thing I came about.”“This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,” saidSancho; “for if he wasn’t he wouldn’t swear by God and his conscience;I feel sure now there must be good souls even in hell itself.”Without dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said,“The unfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, theKnight of the Lions (would that I saw thee in their claws), bidding metell thee to wait for him wherever I may find thee, as he brings withhim her whom they call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee whatis needful in order to disenchant her; and as I came for no more I needstay no longer; demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels withthese gentles;” and so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about andwent off without waiting for a reply from anyone.They all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote;Sancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it thatDulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he could not feel surewhether what had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos was true ornot; and as he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, “Doyou mean to wait, Señor Don Quixote?”“Why not?” replied he; “here will I wait, fearless and firm, though allhell should come to attack me.”“Well then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like the last,I’ll wait here as much as in Flanders,” said Sancho.Night now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flitthrough the wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, thatlook like shooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; afrightful noise, too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels theox-carts usually have, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, theysay, the bears and wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be anywhere they are passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came afurther disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if intruth, on all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles weregoing on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of aterrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were beingdischarged, the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand,and farther away the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again. In aword, the bugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, thecannon, the musketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the carts,all made up together a din so confused and terrific that Don Quixotehad need to summon up all his courage to brave it; but Sancho’s gaveway, and he fell fainting on the skirt of the duchess’s robe, who lethim lie there and promptly bade them throw water in his face. This wasdone, and he came to himself by the time that one of the carts with thecreaking wheels reached the spot. It was drawn by four plodding oxenall covered with black housings; on each horn they had fixed a largelighted wax taper, and on the top of the cart was constructed a raisedseat, on which sat a venerable old man with a beard whiter than thevery snow, and so long that it fell below his waist; he was dressed ina long robe of black buckram; for as the cart was thickly set with amultitude of candles it was easy to make out everything that was on it.Leading it were two hideous demons, also clad in buckram, withcountenances so frightful that Sancho, having once seen them, shut hiseyes so as not to see them again. As soon as the cart came opposite thespot the old man rose from his lofty seat, and standing up said in aloud voice, “I am the sage Lirgandeo,” and without another word thecart then passed on. Behind it came another of the same form, withanother aged man enthroned, who, stopping the cart, said in a voice noless solemn than that of the first, “I am the sage Alquife, the greatfriend of Urganda the Unknown,” and passed on. Then another cart cameby at the same pace, but the occupant of the throne was not old likethe others, but a man stalwart and robust, and of a forbiddingcountenance, who as he came up said in a voice far hoarser and moredevilish, “I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal enemy of Amadis ofGaul and all his kindred,” and then passed on. Having gone a shortdistance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of theirwheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, but soundof sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking it tobe a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not stir astep, or for a single instant, “Señora, where there’s music there can’tbe mischief.”“Nor where there are lights and it is bright,” said the duchess; towhich Sancho replied, “Fire gives light, and it’s bright where thereare bonfires, as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps mayburn us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.”“That remains to be seen,” said Don Quixote, who was listening to allthat passed; and he was right, as is shown in the following chapter.p34e.jpg (47K)CHAPTER XXXV.WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO DON QUIXOTE TOUCHING THEDISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MARVELLOUS INCIDENTSp35a.jpg (108K)Full SizeThey saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music,what they call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with whitelinen housings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also inwhite, with a large lighted wax taper in his hand. The car was twiceor, perhaps, three times as large as the former ones, and in front andon the sides stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and allwith lighted tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; andon a raised throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude ofsilver-tissue veils with an embroidery of countless gold spanglesglittering all over them, that made her appear, if not richly, at leastbrilliantly, apparelled. She had her face covered with thin transparentsendal, the texture of which did not prevent the fair features of amaiden from being distinguished, while the numerous lights made itpossible to judge of her beauty and of her years, which seemed to benot less than seventeen but not to have yet reached twenty. Beside herwas a figure in a robe of state, as they call it, reaching to the feet,while the head was covered with a black veil. But the instant the carwas opposite the duke and duchess and Don Quixote the music of theclarions ceased, and then that of the lutes and harps on the car, andthe figure in the robe rose up, and flinging it apart and removing theveil from its face, disclosed to their eyes the shape of Death itself,fleshless and hideous, at which sight Don Quixote felt uneasy, Sanchofrightened, and the duke and duchess displayed a certain trepidation.Having risen to its feet, this living death, in a sleepy voice and witha tongue hardly awake, held forth as follows:p35b.jpg (232K)Full SizeI am that Merlin who the legends sayThe devil had for father, and the lieHath gathered credence with the lapse of time.Of magic prince, of Zoroastric loreMonarch and treasurer, with jealous eyeI view the efforts of the age to hideThe gallant deeds of doughty errant knights,Who are, and ever have been, dear to me.    Enchanters and magicians and their kindAre mostly hard of heart; not so am I;For mine is tender, soft, compassionate,And its delight is doing good to all.In the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis,Where, tracing mystic lines and characters,My soul abideth now, there came to meThe sorrow-laden plaint of her, the fair,The peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.I knew of her enchantment and her fate,From high-born dame to peasant wench transformedAnd touched with pity, first I turned the leavesOf countless volumes of my devilish craft,And then, in this grim grisly skeletonMyself encasing, hither have I comeTo show where lies the fitting remedyTo give relief in such a piteous case.    O thou, the pride and pink of all that I wearThe adamantine steel! O shining light,O beacon, polestar, path and guide of allWho, scorning slumber and the lazy down,Adopt the toilsome life of bloodstained arms!To thee, great hero who all praise transcends,La Mancha’s lustre and Iberia’s star,Don Quixote, wise as brave, to thee I say—For peerless Dulcinea del TobosoHer pristine form and beauty to regain,’Tis needful that thy esquire Sancho shall,On his own sturdy buttocks bared to heaven,Three thousand and three hundred lashes lay,And that they smart and sting and hurt him well.Thus have the authors of her woe resolved.And this is, gentles, wherefore I have come.“By all that’s good,” exclaimed Sancho at this, “I’ll just as soon givemyself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand,lashes. The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don’t see what mybackside has got to do with enchantments. By God, if Señor Merlin hasnot found out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea delToboso, she may go to her grave enchanted.”“But I’ll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,” said Don Quixote,“and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth,and give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousandsix hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won’t be got rid ofif you try three thousand three hundred times; don’t answer me a wordor I’ll tear your soul out.”On hearing this Merlin said, “That will not do, for the lashes worthySancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not byforce, and at whatever time he pleases, for there is no fixed limitassigned to him; but it is permitted him, if he likes to commute byhalf the pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the hand ofanother, though it may be somewhat weighty.”“Not a hand, my own or anybody else’s, weighty or weighable, shalltouch me,” said Sancho. “Was it I that gave birth to the lady Dulcineadel Toboso, that my backside is to pay for the sins of her eyes? Mymaster, indeed, that’s a part of her—for, he’s always calling her ‘mylife’ and ‘my soul,’ and his stay and prop—may and ought to whiphimself for her and take all the trouble required for herdisenchantment. But for me to whip myself! Abernuncio!”As soon as Sancho had done speaking the nymph in silver that was at theside of Merlin’s ghost stood up, and removing the thin veil from herface disclosed one that seemed to all something more than exceedinglybeautiful; and with a masculine freedom from embarrassment and in avoice not very like a lady’s, addressing Sancho directly, said, “Thouwretched squire, soul of a pitcher, heart of a cork tree, with bowelsof flint and pebbles; if, thou impudent thief, they bade thee throwthyself down from some lofty tower; if, enemy of mankind, they askedthee to swallow a dozen of toads, two of lizards, and three of adders;if they wanted thee to slay thy wife and children with a sharpmurderous scimitar, it would be no wonder for thee to show thyselfstubborn and squeamish. But to make a piece of work about threethousand three hundred lashes, what every poor little charity-boy getsevery month—it is enough to amaze, astonish, astound the compassionatebowels of all who hear it, nay, all who come to hear it in the courseof time. Turn, O miserable, hard-hearted animal, turn, I say, thosetimorous owl’s eyes upon these of mine that are compared to radiantstars, and thou wilt see them weeping trickling streams and rills, andtracing furrows, tracks, and paths over the fair fields of my cheeks.Let it move thee, crafty, ill-conditioned monster, to see my bloomingyouth—still in its teens, for I am not yet twenty—wasting and witheringaway beneath the husk of a rude peasant wench; and if I do not appearin that shape now, it is a special favour Señor Merlin here has grantedme, to the sole end that my beauty may soften thee; for the tears ofbeauty in distress turn rocks into cotton and tigers into ewes. Lay onto that hide of thine, thou great untamed brute, rouse up thy lustyvigour that only urges thee to eat and eat, and set free the softnessof my flesh, the gentleness of my nature, and the fairness of my face.And if thou wilt not relent or come to reason for me, do so for thesake of that poor knight thou hast beside thee; thy master I mean,whose soul I can this moment see, how he has it stuck in his throat notten fingers from his lips, and only waiting for thy inflexible oryielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or go back again intohis stomach.”Don Quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke hesaid, “By God, señor, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck here inmy throat like the nut of a crossbow.”“What say you to this, Sancho?” said the duchess.“I say, señora,” returned Sancho, “what I said before; as for thelashes, abernuncio!”“Abrenuncio, you should say, Sancho, and not as you do,” said the duke.“Let me alone, your highness,” said Sancho. “I’m not in a humour now tolook into niceties or a letter more or less, for these lashes that areto be given me, or I’m to give myself, have so upset me, that I don’tknow what I’m saying or doing. But I’d like to know of this lady, mylady Dulcinea del Toboso, where she learned this way she has of askingfavours. She comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes, and shecalls me soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute, and a string offoul names that the devil is welcome to. Is my flesh brass? or is itanything to me whether she is enchanted or not? Does she bring with hera basket of fair linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks—not that I wear any—tocoax me? No, nothing but one piece of abuse after another, though sheknows the proverb they have here that ‘an ass loaded with gold goeslightly up a mountain,’ and that ‘gifts break rocks,’ and ‘praying toGod and plying the hammer,’ and that ‘one “take” is better than two“I’ll give thee’s.”’ Then there’s my master, who ought to stroke medown and pet me to make me turn wool and carded cotton; he says if hegets hold of me he’ll tie me naked to a tree and double the tale oflashes on me. These tender-hearted gentry should consider that it’s notmerely a squire, but a governor they are asking to whip himself; justas if it was ‘drink with cherries.’ Let them learn, plague take them,the right way to ask, and beg, and behave themselves; for all times arenot alike, nor are people always in good humour. I’m now ready to burstwith grief at seeing my green coat torn, and they come to ask me towhip myself of my own free will, I having as little fancy for it as forturning cacique.”“Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho,” said the duke, “that unlessyou become softer than a ripe fig, you shall not get hold of thegovernment. It would be a nice thing for me to send my islanders acruel governor with flinty bowels, who won’t yield to the tears ofafflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise, magisterial, ancientenchanters and sages. In short, Sancho, either you must be whipped byyourself, or they must whip you, or you shan’t be governor.”“Señor,” said Sancho, “won’t two days’ grace be given me in which toconsider what is best for me?”“No, certainly not,” said Merlin; “here, this minute, and on the spot,the matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will return to the cave ofMontesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, or else in herpresent form shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she willremain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.”“Now then, Sancho!” said the duchess, “show courage, and gratitude foryour master Don Quixote’s bread that you have eaten; we are all boundto oblige and please him for his benevolent disposition and loftychivalry. Consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with thedevil, and leave fear to milksops, for ‘a stout heart breaks bad luck,’as you very well know.”To this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressingMerlin, he made to him, “Will your worship tell me, Señor Merlin—whenthat courier devil came up he gave my master a message from SeñorMontesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming toarrange how the lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted;but up to the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything likehim.”To which Merlin made answer, “The devil, Sancho, is a blockhead and agreat scoundrel; I sent him to look for your master, but not with amessage from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his caveexpecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment;for there’s the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes youanything, or you have any business to transact with him, I’ll bring himto you and put him where you choose; but for the present make up yourmind to consent to this penance, and believe me it will be very goodfor you, for soul as well for body—for your soul because of the charitywith which you perform it, for your body because I know that you are ofa sanguine habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.”“There are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters aredoctors,” said Sancho; “however, as everybody tells me the samething—though I can’t see it myself—I say I am willing to give myselfthe three thousand three hundred lashes, provided I am to lay them onwhenever I like, without any fixing of days or times; and I’ll try andget out of debt as quickly as I can, that the world may enjoy thebeauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems, contrary to what Ithought, that she is beautiful after all. It must be a condition, too,that I am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge, and that ifany of the lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count. Item,that, in case I should make any mistake in the reckoning, Señor Merlin,as he knows everything, is to keep count, and let me know how many arestill wanting or over the number.”“There will be no need to let you know of any over,” said Merlin,“because, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcinea will atonce, and that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in hergratitude to seek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him, and even rewardhim for the good work. So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripestoo many or too few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hairof his head.”“Well then, in God’s hands be it,” said Sancho; “in the hard case I’min I give in; I say I accept the penance on the conditions laid down.”The instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarionsstruck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, andDon Quixote hung on Sancho’s neck kissing him again and again on theforehead and cheeks. The duchess and the duke expressed the greatestsatisfaction, the car began to move on, and as it passed the fairDulcinea bowed to the duke and duchess and made a low curtsey toSancho.p35c.jpg (284K)Full SizeAnd now bright smiling dawn came on apace; the flowers of the field,revived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks,murmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay theirtribute to the expectant rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, thefresh breeze, the clear light, each and all showed that the day thatcame treading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright. Theduke and duchess, pleased with their hunt and at having carried outtheir plans so cleverly and successfully, returned to their castleresolved to follow up their joke; for to them there was no reality thatcould afford them more amusement.p35e.jpg (10K)CHAPTER XXXVI.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THEDISTRESSED DUENNA, ALIAS THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI, TOGETHER WITH A LETTERWHICH SANCHO PANZA WROTE TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZAp36a.jpg (150K)Full SizeThe duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn, and heit was that played the part of Merlin, made all the arrangements forthe late adventure, composed the verses, and got a page to representDulcinea; and now, with the assistance of his master and mistress, hegot up another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can beimagined.The duchess asked Sancho the next day if he had made a beginning withhis penance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment ofDulcinea. He said he had, and had given himself five lashes overnight.The duchess asked him what he had given them with.He said with his hand.“That,” said the duchess, “is more like giving oneself slaps thanlashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with suchtenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or acat-o’-nine tails, that will make itself felt; for it’s with blood thatletters enter, and the release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will notbe granted so cheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho,that works of charity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way arewithout merit and of no avail.”To which Sancho replied, “If your ladyship will give me a properscourge or cord, I’ll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt toomuch; for you must know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton thanhemp, and it won’t do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybodyelse.”“So be it by all means,” said the duchess; “to-morrow I’ll give you ascourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodateitself to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister.”Then said Sancho, “Your highness must know, dear lady of my soul, thatI have a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her an accountof all that has happened me since I left her; I have it here in mybosom, and there’s nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I’d beglad if your discretion would read it, for I think it runs in thegovernor style; I mean the way governors ought to write.”“And who dictated it?” asked the duchess.“Who should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?” said Sancho.“And did you write it yourself?” said the duchess.“That I didn’t,” said Sancho; “for I can neither read nor write, thoughI can sign my name.”“Let us see it,” said the duchess, “for never fear but you display init the quality and quantity of your wit.”Sancho drew out an open letter from his bosom, and the duchess, takingit, found it ran in this fashion:SANCHO PANZA’S LETTER TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZAIf I was well whipped I went mounted like a gentleman; if I have got agood government it is at the cost of a good whipping. Thou wilt notunderstand this just now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what itmeans. I may tell thee, Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for thatis a matter of importance, because every other way of going is going onall-fours. Thou art a governor’s wife; take care that nobody speaksevil of thee behind thy back. I send thee here a green hunting suitthat my lady the duchess gave me; alter it so as to make a petticoatand bodice for our daughter. Don Quixote, my master, if I am to believewhat I hear in these parts, is a madman of some sense, and a drollblockhead, and I am in no way behind him. We have been in the cave ofMontesinos, and the sage Merlin has laid hold of me for thedisenchantment of Dulcinea del Toboso, her that is called AldonzaLorenzo over there. With three thousand three hundred lashes, lessfive, that I’m to give myself, she will be left as entirelydisenchanted as the mother that bore her. Say nothing of this toanyone; for, make thy affairs public, and some will say they are whiteand others will say they are black. I shall leave this in a few daysfor my government, to which I am going with a mighty great desire tomake money, for they tell me all new governors set out with the samedesire; I will feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou artto come and live with me or not. Dapple is well and sends manyremembrances to thee; I am not going to leave him behind though theytook me away to be Grand Turk. My lady the duchess kisses thy hands athousand times; do thou make a return with two thousand, for as mymaster says, nothing costs less or is cheaper than civility. God hasnot been pleased to provide another valise for me with another hundredcrowns, like the one the other day; but never mind, my Teresa, thebell-ringer is in safe quarters, and all will come out in the scouringof the government; only it troubles me greatly what they tell me—thatonce I have tasted it I will eat my hands off after it; and if that isso it will not come very cheap to me; though to be sure the maimed havea benefice of their own in the alms they beg for; so that one way oranother thou wilt be rich and in luck. God give it to thee as he can,and keep me to serve thee. From this castle, the 20th of July, 1614.Thy husband, the governor,SANCHO PANZAWhen she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, “Ontwo points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying orhinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashesthat he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) thatwhen my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such athing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be verycovetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for ‘covetousnessbursts the bag,’ and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.”“I don’t mean it that way, señora,” said Sancho; “and if you think theletter doesn’t run as it ought to do, it’s only to tear it up and makeanother; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to mygumption.”“No, no,” said the duchess, “this one will do, and I wish the duke tosee it.”With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine,and the duchess showed Sancho’s letter to the duke, who was highlydelighted with it. They dined, and after the cloth had been removed andthey had amused themselves for a while with Sancho’s rich conversation,the melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum made itselfheard. All seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused, martialharmony, especially Don Quixote, who could not keep his seat from puredisquietude; as to Sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove him tohis usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed andin truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one.While they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards themthrough the garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowingthat they trailed upon the ground. As they marched they beat two greatdrums which were likewise draped in black, and beside them came thefife player, black and sombre like the others. Following these came apersonage of gigantic stature enveloped rather than clad in a gown ofthe deepest black, the skirt of which was of prodigious dimensions.Over the gown, girdling or crossing his figure, he had a broad baldricwhich was also black, and from which hung a huge scimitar with a blackscabbard and furniture. He had his face covered with a transparentblack veil, through which might be descried a very long beard as whiteas snow. He came on keeping step to the sound of the drums with greatgravity and dignity; and, in short, his stature, his gait, thesombreness of his appearance and his following might well have struckwith astonishment, as they did, all who beheld him without knowing whohe was. With this measured pace and in this guise he advanced to kneelbefore the duke, who, with the others, awaited him standing. The duke,however, would not on any account allow him to speak until he hadrisen. The prodigious scarecrow obeyed, and standing up, removed theveil from his face and disclosed the most enormous, the longest, thewhitest and the thickest beard that human eyes had ever beheld untilthat moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous voice from thedepths of his broad, capacious chest, and fixing his eyes on the duke,he said:“Most high and mighty señor, my name is Trifaldin of the White Beard; Iam squire to the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the DistressedDuenna, on whose behalf I bear a message to your highness, which isthat your magnificence will be pleased to grant her leave andpermission to come and tell you her trouble, which is one of thestrangest and most wonderful that the mind most familiar with troublein the world could have imagined; but first she desires to know if thevaliant and never vanquished knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, is inthis your castle, for she has come in quest of him on foot and withoutbreaking her fast from the kingdom of Kandy to your realms here; athing which may and ought to be regarded as a miracle or set down toenchantment; she is even now at the gate of this fortress or plaisance,and only waits for your permission to enter. I have spoken.” And withthat he coughed, and stroked down his beard with both his hands, andstood very tranquilly waiting for the response of the duke, which wasto this effect: “Many days ago, worthy squire Trifaldin of the WhiteBeard, we heard of the misfortune of my lady the Countess Trifaldi,whom the enchanters have caused to be called the Distressed Duenna. Bidher enter, O stupendous squire, and tell her that the valiant knightDon Quixote of La Mancha is here, and from his generous disposition shemay safely promise herself every protection and assistance; and you maytell her, too, that if my aid be necessary it will not be withheld, forI am bound to give it to her by my quality of knight, which involvesthe protection of women of all sorts, especially widowed, wronged, anddistressed dames, such as her ladyship seems to be.”On hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making asign to the fifer and drummers to strike up, he turned and marched outof the garden to the same notes and at the same pace as when heentered, leaving them all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. Turningto Don Quixote, the duke said, “After all, renowned knight, the mistsof malice and ignorance are unable to hide or obscure the light ofvalour and virtue. I say so, because your excellence has been barelysix days in this castle, and already the unhappy and the afflicted comein quest of you from lands far distant and remote, and not in coachesor on dromedaries, but on foot and fasting, confident that in thatmighty arm they will find a cure for their sorrows and troubles; thanksto your great achievements, which are circulated all over the knownearth.”“I wish, señor duke,” replied Don Quixote, “that blessed ecclesiastic,who at table the other day showed such ill-will and bitter spiteagainst knights-errant, were here now to see with his own eyes whetherknights of the sort are needed in the world; he would at any rate learnby experience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction orsorrow, in extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look fora remedy to the houses of jurists or village sacristans, or to theknight who has never attempted to pass the bounds of his own town, orto the indolent courtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of,instead of striving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate andrecord. Relief in distress, help in need, protection for damsels,consolation for widows, are to be found in no sort of persons betterthan in knights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I amone, and regard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in thepursuit of so honourable a calling as endured to good purpose. Let thisduenna come and ask what she will, for I will effect her relief by themight of my arm and the dauntless resolution of my bold heart.”p36e.jpg (22K)CHAPTER XXXVII.WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNAp37a.jpg (94K)Full SizeThe duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixotefell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, “I hopethis señora duenna won’t be putting any difficulties in the way of thepromise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, whotalked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothinggood could happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that sameapothecary! And so what I’m thinking is, if all duennas, of whateversort or condition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what mustthey be that are distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts orThree-tails!—for in my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it’sall one.”“Hush, friend Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “since this lady duenna comesin quest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those theapothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when countessesserve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses, for intheir own houses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennasto wait on them.”To this Doña Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, “My lady theduchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it wasthe will of fortune; ‘but laws go as kings like;’ let nobody speak illof duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not onemyself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has overone that is a widow; but ‘he who clipped us has kept the scissors.’”“For all that,” said Sancho, “there’s so much to be clipped aboutduennas, so my barber said, that ‘it will be better not to stir therice even though it sticks.’”“These squires,” returned Doña Rodriguez, “are always our enemies; andas they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and watch us atevery step, whenever they are not saying their prayers (and that’soften enough) they spend their time in tattling about us, digging upour bones and burying our good name. But I can tell these walkingblocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great houses too,though we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not,with widow’s weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on a processionday. By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, I couldprove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, that thereis no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.”“I have no doubt,” said the duchess, “that my good Doña Rodriguez isright, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for fightingher own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to crush thecalumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in thegreat Sancho Panza’s mind.”To which Sancho replied, “Ever since I have sniffed the governorship Ihave got rid of the humours of a squire, and I don’t care a wild figfor all the duennas in the world.”They would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they notheard the notes of the fife and drums once more, from which theyconcluded that the Distressed Duenna was making her entrance. Theduchess asked the duke if it would be proper to go out to receive her,as she was a countess and a person of rank.“In respect of her being a countess,” said Sancho, before the dukecould reply, “I am for your highnesses going out to receive her; but inrespect of her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should not stir astep.”“Who bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.“Who, señor?” said Sancho; “I meddle for I have a right to meddle, as asquire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of yourworship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world ofcourtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship say, asmuch is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one whohas his ears open, few words.”“Sancho is right,” said the duke; “we’ll see what the countess is like,and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.”And now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here theauthor brought this short chapter to an end and began the next,following up the same adventure, which is one of the most notable inthe history.p37e.jpg (21K)CHAPTER XXXVIII.WHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA’S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNESp38a.jpg (54K)Full SizeFollowing the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as manyas twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robesapparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long thatthey allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them camethe Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leadingher by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that,had it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea;the tail, or skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in threepoints which were borne up by the hands of three pages, likewisedressed in mourning, forming an elegant geometrical figure with thethree acute angles made by the three points, from which all who saw thepeaked skirt concluded that it must be because of it the countess wascalled Trifaldi, as though it were Countess of the Three Skirts; andBenengeli says it was so, and that by her right name she was called theCountess Lobuna, because wolves bred in great numbers in her country;and if, instead of wolves, they had been foxes, she would have beencalled the Countess Zorruna, as it was the custom in those parts forlords to take distinctive titles from the thing or things most abundantin their dominions; this countess, however, in honour of the newfashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up Trifaldi.The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their facesbeing covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin’s,but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soonas the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, andDon Quixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-movingprocession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along whichthe Distressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. Onseeing this the duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelvepaces forward to meet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in avoice hoarse and rough, rather than fine and delicate, “May it pleaseyour highnesses not to offer such courtesies to this your servant, Ishould say to this your handmaid, for I am in such distress that Ishall never be able to make a proper return, because my strange andunparalleled misfortune has carried off my wits, and I know notwhither; but it must be a long way off, for the more I look for themthe less I find them.”“He would be wanting in wits, señora countess,” said the duke, “who didnot perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it may be seenit deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage;” andraising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside the duchess, wholikewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixote remained silent,while Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi and one or twoof her many duennas; but there was no possibility of it until theythemselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.All kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which theDistressed Duenna did in these words: “I am confident, most mightylord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserablemisery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generousand condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enoughto melt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the mosthardened hearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing,not to say your ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there bepresent in this society, circle, or company, that knightimmaculatissimus, Don Quixote de la Manchissima, and his squirissimusPanza.”“The Panza is here,” said Sancho, before anyone could reply, “and DonQuixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima, you may saywhat you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you anyservissimus.”On this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said,“If your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relieffrom the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which,feeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to yourservice. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aidto the needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary foryou, señora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles,only to tell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you havehearers that will know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise withthem.”On hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throwherself at Don Quixote’s feet, and actually did fall before them andsaid, as she strove to embrace them, “Before these feet and legs I castmyself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the foundationsand pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss, for upontheir steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune, Ovalorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipsethe fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!” Thenturning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, shesaid, “O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in thispresent age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than thebeard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boastthyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving,summed up in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne armsin the world. I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyalgoodness, that thou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master,that he speedily give aid to this most humble and most unfortunatecountess.”To this Sancho made answer, “As to my goodness, señora, being as longand as great as your squire’s beard, it matters very little to me; mayI have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit thislife, that’s the point; about beards here below I care little ornothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg mymaster (for I know he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me justnow for a certain business) to help and aid your worship as far as hecan; unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal withthem, for we’ll be all of one mind.”The duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment ofthis adventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, andbetween themselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi,who, returning to her seat, said, “Queen Doña Maguncia reigned over thefamous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and theSouthern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow ofKing Archipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they hadissue the Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which PrincessAntonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction, Ibeing the oldest and highest in rank of her mother’s duennas. Timepassed, and the young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and sucha perfection of beauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, itmust not be supposed her intelligence was childish; she was asintelligent as she was fair, and she was fairer than all the world; andis so still, unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters threehave cut for her the thread of life. But that they have not, for Heavenwill not suffer so great a wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluckunripe the grapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface. Of thisbeauty, to which my poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice,countless princes, not only of that country, but of others, wereenamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was at the court,dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty, trustingto his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishments andgraces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell yourhighnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so asto make it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, andhe could make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he mighthave gained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utterpoverty; and gifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down amountain, not to say a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit,and gaiety, all his graces and accomplishments, would have been oflittle or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil, had notthe impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first.First, the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-willand purchase my compliance, so as to get me, like a treacherous warder,to deliver up to him the keys of the fortress I had in charge. In aword, he gained an influence over my mind, and overcame my resolutionswith I know not what trinkets and jewels he gave me; but it was someverses I heard him singing one night from a grating that opened on thestreet where he lived, that, more than anything else, made me give wayand led to my fall; and if I remember rightly they ran thus:From that sweet enemy of mine    My bleeding heart hath had its wound;    And to increase the pain I’m boundTo suffer and to make no sign.The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; andafterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune intowhich I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, oughtto be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones,for they write verses, not like those of ‘The Marquis of Mantua,’ thatdelight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointedconceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightningstrike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:Come Death, so subtly veiled that I    Thy coming know not, how or when,    Lest it should give me life againTo find how sweet it is to die.—and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant whensung and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend tocompose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, whichthey call seguidillas! Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaksforth, and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver.And so I say, sirs, that these troubadours richly deserve to bebanished to the isles of the lizards. Though it is not they that are infault, but the simpletons that extol them, and the fools that believein them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should have been, hisstale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have been takenin by such phrases as ‘in death I live,’ ‘in ice I burn,’ ‘in flames Ishiver,’ ‘hopeless I hope,’ ‘I go and stay,’ and paradoxes of that sortwhich their writings are full of. And then when they promise the Phœnixof Arabia, the crown of Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls ofthe South, the gold of Tibar, and the balsam of Panchaia! Then it isthey give a loose to their pens, for it costs them little to makepromises they have no intention or power of fulfilling. But where am Iwandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What madness or folly leadsme to speak of the faults of others, when there is so much to be saidabout my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not versesthat conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made meyield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little cautionopened the way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo’s advances, forthat was the name of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with myhelp as go-between, he found his way many a time into the chamber ofthe deceived Antonomasia (deceived not by him but by me) under thetitle of a lawful husband; for, sinner though I was, I would not haveallowed him to approach the edge of her shoe-sole without being herhusband. No, no, not that; marriage must come first in any business ofthis sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in this case,which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a privategentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to thekingdom. The entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hiddenby my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansionof waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it, the dread ofwhich made us all there take counsel together, and it was agreed thatbefore the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demandAntonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement tomarry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such bindingterms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessarysteps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady’sconfession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her intothe custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.”“Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,” said Sancho at this,“and poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is the same allover! But make haste, Señora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I am dyingto know the end of this long story.”“I will,” replied the countess.p38e.jpg (22K)CHAPTER XXXIX.IN WHICH THE TRIFALDI CONTINUES HER MARVELLOUS AND MEMORABLE STORYp39a.jpg (96K)Full SizeBy every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted asDon Quixote was driven to desperation. He bade him hold his tongue, andthe Distressed One went on to say: “At length, after much questioningand answering, as the princess held to her story, without changing orvarying her previous declaration, the Vicar gave his decision in favourof Don Clavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife;which the Queen Doña Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia’s mother, sotook to heart, that within the space of three days we buried her.”“She died, no doubt,” said Sancho.“Of course,” said Trifaldin; “they don’t bury living people in Kandy,only the dead.”“Señor Squire,” said Sancho, “a man in a swoon has been known to beburied before now, in the belief that he was dead; and it struck methat Queen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died; becausewith life a great many things come right, and the princess’s folly wasnot so great that she need feel it so keenly. If the lady had marriedsome page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as many anotherhas done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have been pastcuring. But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has beenjust now described to us—indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it wasnot such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of mymaster here—and he won’t allow me to lie—as of men of letters bishopsare made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kingsand emperors may be made.”“Thou art right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for with a knight-errant,if he has but two fingers’ breadth of good fortune, it is on the cardsto become the mightiest lord on earth. But let señora the DistressedOne proceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter partof this so far sweet story.”“The bitter is indeed to come,” said the countess; “and such bitterthat colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. Thequeen, then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardlyhad we covered her with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells,when, _quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis?_ over the queen’s gravethere appeared, mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno,Maguncia’s first cousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; andhe, to revenge the death of his cousin, punish the audacity of DonClavijo, and in wrath at the contumacy of Antonomasia, left them bothenchanted by his art on the grave itself; she being changed into an apeof brass, and he into a horrible crocodile of some unknown metal; whilebetween the two there stands a pillar, also of metal, with certaincharacters in the Syriac language inscribed upon it, which, beingtranslated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain the followingsentence: ‘These two rash lovers shall not recover their former shapeuntil the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in singlecombat; for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his mightyvalour alone.’ This done, he drew from its sheath a huge broadscimitar, and seizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cutmy throat and shear my head clean off. I was terror-stricken, my voicestuck in my throat, and I was in the deepest distress; nevertheless Isummoned up my strength as well as I could, and in a trembling andpiteous voice I addressed such words to him as induced him to stay theinfliction of a punishment so severe. He then caused all the duennas ofthe palace, those that are here present, to be brought before him; andafter having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and denouncedduennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues, layingto the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would notvisit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow naturewhich would be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant heceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening, andpricking us, as if with the points of needles. We at once put our handsup to our faces and found ourselves in the state you now see.”Here the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils withwhich they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling withbeards, some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at whichspectacle the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder.Don Quixote and Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and thebystanders lost in astonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say:“Thus did that malevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering thetenderness and softness of our faces with these rough bristles! Wouldto heaven that he had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitarinstead of obscuring the light of our countenances with thesewool-combings that cover us! For if we look into the matter, sirs (andwhat I am now going to say I would say with eyes flowing likefountains, only that the thought of our misfortune and the oceans theyhave already wept, keep them as dry as barley spears, and so I say itwithout tears), where, I ask, can a duenna with a beard go to? Whatfather or mother will feel pity for her? Who will help her? For, ifeven when she has a smooth skin, and a face tortured by a thousandkinds of washes and cosmetics, she can hardly get anybody to love her,what will she do when she shows a countenance turned into a thicket? Ohduennas, companions mine! it was an unlucky moment when we were bornand an ill-starred hour when our fathers begot us!” And as she saidthis she showed signs of being about to faint.p39e.jpg (27K)CHAPTER XL.OF MATTERS RELATING AND BELONGING TO THIS ADVENTURE AND TO THISMEMORABLE HISTORYp40a.jpg (129K)Full SizeVerily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like thisought show their gratitude to Cide Hamete, its original author, for thescrupulous care he has taken to set before us all its minuteparticulars, not leaving anything, however trifling it may be, that hedoes not make clear and plain. He portrays the thoughts, he reveals thefancies, he answers implied questions, clears up doubts, setsobjections at rest, and, in a word, makes plain the smallest points themost inquisitive can desire to know. O renowned author! O happy DonQuixote! O famous famous droll Sancho! All and each, may ye livecountless ages for the delight and amusement of the dwellers on earth!The history goes on to say that when Sancho saw the Distressed Onefaint he exclaimed: “I swear by the faith of an honest man and theshades of all my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of,nor has my master related or conceived in his mind, such an adventureas this. A thousand devils—not to curse thee—take thee, Malambruno, foran enchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishmentfor these sinners but bearding them? Would it not have been better—itwould have been better for them—to have taken off half their noses fromthe middle upwards, even though they’d have snuffled when they spoke,than to have put beards on them? I’ll bet they have not the means ofpaying anybody to shave them.”“That is the truth, señor,” said one of the twelve; “we have not themoney to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us, taken tousing sticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for by applyingthem to our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bareand smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. There are, to be sure,women in Kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, andtrim eyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, theduennas of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have aflavour of agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are notrelieved by Señor Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves withbeards.”“I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,” said Don Quixote,“if I don’t cure yours.”At this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, “Thechink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst ofmy swoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back mysenses; and so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitablesir, to let your gracious promises be turned into deeds.”“There shall be no delay on my part,” said Don Quixote. “Bethink you,señora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager to serve you.”“The fact is,” replied the Distressed One, “it is five thousandleagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of Kandy, ifyou go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straight line,it is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know, too,that Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight ourdeliverer, he himself would send him a steed far better and with lesstricks than a post-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse onwhich the valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which saidhorse is guided by a peg he has in his forehead that serves for abridle, and flies through the air with such rapidity that you wouldfancy the very devils were carrying him. This horse, according toancient tradition, was made by Merlin. He lent him to Pierres, who wasa friend of his, and who made long journeys with him, and, as has beensaid, carried off the fair Magalona, bearing her through the air on itshaunches and making all who beheld them from the earth gape withastonishment; and he never lent him save to those whom he loved orthose who paid him well; and since the great Pierres we know of no onehaving mounted him until now. From him Malambruno stole him by hismagic art, and he has him now in his possession, and makes use of himin his journeys which he constantly makes through different parts ofthe world; he is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day inPotosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleepsnor wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the airwithout wings, so that he whom he has mounted upon him can carry a cupfull of water in his hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly andeasily does he go, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed ridinghim greatly.”“For going smoothly and easily,” said Sancho at this, “give me myDapple, though he can’t go through the air; but on the ground I’ll backhim against all the amblers in the world.”They all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: “And this samehorse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to oursufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advancedhalf an hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give mewhereby I might know that I had found the knight I was in quest of,would be to send me the horse wherever he might be, speedily andpromptly.”“And how many is there room for on this horse?” asked Sancho.“Two,” said the Distressed One, “one in the saddle, and the other onthe croup; and generally these two are knight and squire, when there isno damsel that’s being carried off.”“I’d like to know, Señora Distressed One,” said Sancho, “what is thename of this horse?”“His name,” said the Distressed One, “is not the same as Bellerophon’shorse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great’s, calledBucephalus, or Orlando Furioso’s, the name of which was Brigliador, noryet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor Frontino likeRuggiero’s, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the horses of the sunwere called, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse on which theunfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the battlewhere he lost his life and his kingdom.”“I’ll bet,” said Sancho, “that as they have given him none of thesefamous names of well-known horses, no more have they given him the nameof my master’s Rocinante, which for being apt surpasses all that havebeen mentioned.”“That is true,” said the bearded countess, “still it fits him verywell, for he is called Clavileño the Swift, which name is in accordancewith his being made of wood, with the peg he has in his forehead, andwith the swift pace at which he travels; and so, as far as name goes,he may compare with the famous Rocinante.”“I have nothing to say against his name,” said Sancho; “but with whatsort of bridle or halter is he managed?”“I have said already,” said the Trifaldi, “that it is with a peg, byturning which to one side or the other the knight who rides him makeshim go as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimming andalmost sweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that is soughtand followed in all well-regulated proceedings.”“I’d like to see him,” said Sancho; “but to fancy I’m going to mounthim, either in the saddle or on the croup, is to ask pears of the elmtree. A good joke indeed! I can hardly keep my seat upon Dapple, and ona pack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they’d have me hold onupon haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort! Gad, I haveno notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone’s beard; let each oneshave himself as best he can; I’m not going to accompany my master onany such long journey; besides, I can’t give any help to the shaving ofthese beards as I can to the disenchantment of my lady Dulcinea.”“Yes, you can, my friend,” replied the Trifaldi; “and so much, thatwithout you, so I understand, we shall be able to do nothing.”“In the king’s name!” exclaimed Sancho, “what have squires got to dowith the adventures of their masters? Are they to have the fame of suchas they go through, and we the labour? Body o’ me! if the historianswould only say, ‘Such and such a knight finished such and such anadventure, but with the help of so and so, his squire, without which itwould have been impossible for him to accomplish it;’ but they writecurtly, “Don Paralipomenon of the Three Stars accomplished theadventure of the six monsters;’ without mentioning such a person as hissquire, who was there all the time, just as if there was no such being.Once more, sirs, I say my master may go alone, and much good may it dohim; and I’ll stay here in the company of my lady the duchess; andmaybe when he comes back, he will find the lady Dulcinea’s affair everso much advanced; for I mean in leisure hours, and at idle moments, togive myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair to cover me.”“For all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,” said theduchess, “for they are worthy folk who ask you; and the faces of theseladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your idlefears; that would be a hard case indeed.”“In the king’s name, once more!” said Sancho; “If this charitable workwere to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement orcharity-girls, a man might expose himself to some hardships; but tobear it for the sake of stripping beards off duennas! Devil take it!I’d sooner see them all bearded, from the highest to the lowest, andfrom the most prudish to the most affected.”“You are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,” said the duchess;“you incline very much to the opinion of the Toledo apothecary. Butindeed you are wrong; there are duennas in my house that may serve aspatterns of duennas; and here is my Doña Rodriguez, who will not allowme to say otherwise.”“Your excellence may say it if you like,” said the Rodriguez; “for Godknows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas are good or bad,bearded or smooth, we are our mothers’ daughters like other women; andas God sent us into the world, he knows why he did, and on his mercy Irely, and not on anybody’s beard.”“Well, Señora Rodriguez, Señora Trifaldi, and present company,” saidDon Quixote, “I trust in Heaven that it will look with kindly eyes uponyour troubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him. Only let Clavileño comeand let me find myself face to face with Malambruno, and I am certainno razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shaveMalambruno’s head off his shoulders; for ‘God bears with the wicked,but not for ever.’”“Ah!” exclaimed the Distressed One at this, “may all the stars of thecelestial regions look down upon your greatness with benign eyes,valiant knight, and shed every prosperity and valour upon your heart,that it may be the shield and safeguard of the abused and downtroddenrace of duennas, detested by apothecaries, sneered at by squires, andmade game of by pages. Ill betide the jade that in the flower of heryouth would not sooner become a nun than a duenna! Unfortunate beingsthat we are, we duennas! Though we may be descended in the direct maleline from Hector of Troy himself, our mistresses never fail to addressus as ‘you’ if they think it makes queens of them. O giant Malambruno,though thou art an enchanter, thou art true to thy promises. Send usnow the peerless Clavileño, that our misfortune may be brought to anend; for if the hot weather sets in and these beards of ours are stillthere, alas for our lot!”The Trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears fromthe eyes of all and even Sancho’s filled up; and he resolved in hisheart to accompany his master to the uttermost ends of the earth, if sobe the removal of the wool from those venerable countenances dependedupon it.p40e.jpg (13K)CHAPTER XLI.OF THE ARRIVAL OF CLAVILEÑO AND THE END OF THIS PROTRACTED ADVENTUREp41a.jpg (138K)Full SizeAnd now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival ofthe famous horse Clavileño, the non-appearance of which was alreadybeginning to make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, asMalambruno was so long about sending it, either he himself was not theknight for whom the adventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did notdare to meet him in single combat. But lo! suddenly there came into thegarden four wild-men all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders agreat wooden horse. They placed it on its feet on the ground, and oneof the wild-men said, “Let the knight who has heart for it mount thismachine.”Here Sancho exclaimed, “I don’t mount, for neither have I the heart noram I a knight.”“And let the squire, if he has one,” continued the wild-man, “take hisseat on the croup, and let him trust the valiant Malambruno; for by nosword save his, nor by the malice of any other, shall he be assailed.It is but to turn this peg the horse has in his neck, and he will bearthem through the air to where Malambruno awaits them; but lest the vastelevation of their course should make them giddy, their eyes must becovered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign of their havingcompleted their journey.”With these words, leaving Clavileño behind them, they retired with easydignity the way they came. As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse,almost in tears she exclaimed to Don Quixote, “Valiant knight, thepromise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, ourbeards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee toshave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire andmaking a happy beginning with your new journey.”“That I will, Señora Countess Trifaldi,” said Don Quixote, “most gladlyand with right goodwill, without stopping to take a cushion or put onmy spurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire to see you and allthese duennas shaved clean.”“That I won’t,” said Sancho, “with good-will or bad-will, or any way atall; and if this shaving can’t be done without my mounting on thecroup, my master had better look out for another squire to go with him,and these ladies for some other way of making their faces smooth; I’mno witch to have a taste for travelling through the air. What would myislanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling abouton the winds? And another thing, as it is three thousand and oddleagues from this to Kandy, if the horse tires, or the giant takeshuff, we’ll be half a dozen years getting back, and there won’t be isleor island in the world that will know me: and so, as it is a commonsaying ‘in delay there’s danger,’ and ‘when they offer thee a heiferrun with a halter,’ these ladies’ beards must excuse me; ‘Saint Peteris very well in Rome;’ I mean I am very well in this house where somuch is made of me, and I hope for such a good thing from the master asto see myself a governor.”“Friend Sancho,” said the duke at this, “the island that I havepromised you is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it hasroots so deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be noeasy matter to pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know aswell as I do that there is no sort of office of any importance that isnot obtained by a bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, thatwhich I look to receive for this government is that you go with yourmaster Don Quixote, and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion;and whether you return on Clavileño as quickly as his speed seems topromise, or adverse fortune brings you back on foot travelling as apilgrim from hostel to hostel and from inn to inn, you will always findyour island on your return where you left it, and your islanders withthe same eagerness they have always had to receive you as theirgovernor, and my good-will will remain the same; doubt not the truth ofthis, Señor Sancho, for that would be grievously wronging mydisposition to serve you.”“Say no more, señor,” said Sancho; “I am a poor squire and not equal tocarrying so much courtesy; let my master mount; bandage my eyes andcommit me to God’s care, and tell me if I may commend myself to ourLord or call upon the angels to protect me when we go towering upthere.”To this the Trifaldi made answer, “Sancho, you may freely commendyourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter isa Christian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection,taking very good care not to fall out with anyone.”“Well then,” said Sancho, “God and the most holy Trinity of Gaeta giveme help!”“Since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,” said Don Quixote,“I have never seen Sancho in such a fright as now; were I assuperstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some littletrepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave ofthese gentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;” anddrawing Sancho aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both hishands he said, “Thou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we havebefore us, and God knows when we shall return, or what leisure oropportunities this business will allow us; I wish thee therefore toretire now to thy chamber, as though thou wert going to fetch somethingrequired for the road, and in a trice give thyself if it be only fivehundred lashes on account of the three thousand three hundred to whichthou art bound; it will be all to the good, and to make a beginningwith a thing is to have it half finished.”“By God,” said Sancho, “but your worship must be out of your senses!This is like the common saying, ‘You see me with child, and you want mea virgin.’ Just as I’m about to go sitting on a bare board, yourworship would have me score my backside! Indeed, your worship is notreasonable. Let us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return Ipromise on my word to make such haste to wipe off all that’s due aswill satisfy your worship; I can’t say more.”“Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,”replied Don Quixote, “and I believe thou wilt keep it; for indeedthough stupid thou art veracious.”“I’m not voracious,” said Sancho, “only peckish; but even if I was alittle, still I’d keep my word.”With this they went back to mount Clavileño, and as they were about todo so Don Quixote said, “Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for onewho sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive usfor the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving personswho trust in him; though all should turn out the contrary of what Ihope, no malice will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken thisexploit.”“Let us be off, señor,” said Sancho, “for I have taken the beards andtears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan’t eat a bit to relishit until I have seen them restored to their former smoothness. Mount,your worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to go on the croup,it is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of hispocket, he begged the Distressed One to bandage his eyes verycarefully; but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again,saying, “If my memory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of thePalladium of Troy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddessPallas, which was big with armed knights, who were afterwards thedestruction of Troy; so it would be as well to see, first of all, whatClavileño has in his stomach.”“There is no occasion,” said the Distressed One; “I will be bail forhim, and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous abouthim; you may mount without any fear, Señor Don Quixote; on my head beit if any harm befalls you.”Don Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to hissafety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so,without more words, he mounted Clavileño, and tried the peg, whichturned easily; and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, helooked like nothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph paintedor embroidered on a Flemish tapestry.Much against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount,and, after settling himself as well as he could on the croup, found itrather hard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would bepossible to oblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even ifit were off the couch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of thepages; as the haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood.On this the Trifaldi observed that Clavileño would not bear any kind ofharness or trappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sidewayslike a woman, as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.Sancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to bebandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and lookingtenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him inhis present strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that Godmight provide someone to say as many for them, whenever they foundthemselves in a similar emergency.At this Don Quixote exclaimed, “Art thou on the gallows, thief, or atthy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly,spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalonaoccupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but tobecome Queen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am herebeside thee, may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres,who pressed this very spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, coverthine eyes, abject animal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, atleast in my presence.”“Blindfold me,” said Sancho; “as you won’t let me commend myself or becommended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraid there is a region ofdevils about here that will carry us off to Peralvillo?”They were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled tohis satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed hisfingers on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up theirvoices exclaiming, “God guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee,intrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than anarrow! Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at youfrom the earth! Take care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho! Mindthou fall not, for thy fall will be worse than that rash youth’s whotried to steer the chariot of his father the Sun!”As Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and windinghis arms round him, he said, “Señor, how do they make out we are goingup so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speakingquite close to us?”“Don’t mind that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for as affairs of thissort, and flights like this are out of the common course of things, youcan see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don’tsqueeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really I know not whatthou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I can safely swear I nevermounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my life; one would fancywe never stirred from one place. Banish fear, my friend, for indeedeverything is going as it ought, and we have the wind astern.”“That’s true,” said Sancho, “for such a strong wind comes against me onthis side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with athousand pair of bellows;” which was the case; they were puffing at himwith a great pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so wellplanned by the duke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing wasomitted to make it perfectly successful.Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho, wemust have already reached the second region of the air, where the hailand snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and thethunderbolts are engendered in the third region, and if we go onascending at this rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region offire, and I know not how to regulate this peg, so as not to mount upwhere we shall be burned.”And now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow thatcould be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end ofa cane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, “May I die if we are notalready in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of mybeard has been singed, and I have a mind, señor, to uncover and seewhereabouts we are.”“Do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “remember the true story ofthe licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flying through the airriding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached Romeand dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the city, and sawthe whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and was back inMadrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he had seen;and he said moreover that as he was going through the air, the devilbade him open his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near the bodyof the moon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of itwith his hand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest heshould be seized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for usto uncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsiblefor us; and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up toenable us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the sakeror falcon does on the heron, so as to seize it however high it maysoar; and though it seems to us not half an hour since we left thegarden, believe me we must have travelled a great distance.”“I don’t know how that may be,” said Sancho; “all I know is that if theSeñora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she couldnot have been very tender of flesh.”The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to theconversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it;and now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare andwell-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavileño’s tail withsome tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediatelyblew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and SanchoPanza to the ground half singed. By this time the bearded band ofduennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and thosethat remained lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixoteand Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filledwith amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which theyhad started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on theground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of thegarden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hangingfrom it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on whichthere was the following inscription in large gold letters: “Theillustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attemptingit, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi,otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied onevery point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, andKing Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form; and whenthe squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white doveshall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons thatpersecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is thedecree of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.”As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment heperceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea,and returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little dangerachieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexionthe countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards theduke and duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking theduke by the hand he said, “Be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of goodcheer; it’s nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without anyharm done, as the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.”The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousnessafter a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrateabout the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder andamazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what theypretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The dukeread the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace DonQuixote with open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that hadever been seen in any age. Sancho kept looking about for the DistressedOne, to see what her face was like without the beard, and if she was asfair as her elegant person promised; but they told him that, theinstant Clavileño descended flaming through the air and came to theground, the whole band of duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and thatthey were already shaved and without a stump left.The duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on that long journey, towhich Sancho replied, “I felt, señora, that we were flying through theregion of fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyesfor a bit; but my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, wouldnot let me; but as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and adesire to know what is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and withoutanyone seeing me I drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever solittle, close to my nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth,and it seemed to me that it was altogether no bigger than a grain ofmustard seed, and that the men walking on it were little bigger thanhazel nuts; so you may see how high we must have got to then.”To this the duchess said, “Sancho, my friend, mind what you are saying;it seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the men walking onit; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard seed, andeach man like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered the wholeearth.”“That is true,” said Sancho, “but for all that I got a glimpse of a bitof one side of it, and saw it all.”“Take care, Sancho,” said the duchess, “with a bit of one side one doesnot see the whole of what one looks at.”“I don’t understand that way of looking at things,” said Sancho; “Ionly know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as wewere flying by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earth and allthe men by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won’t believethis, no more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to theeyebrows, I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palmand a half between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by,señora, it is mighty great! And it so happened we came by where theseven goats are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was agoatherd in my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing tobe among them for a little, and if I had not given way to it I thinkI’d have burst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without sayinganything to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I gotdown from Clavileño and amused myself with the goats—which are likeviolets, like flowers—for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileñonever stirred or moved from one spot.”“And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,” saidthe duke, “how did Señor Don Quixote amuse himself?”To which Don Quixote replied, “As all these things and such likeoccurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonderthat Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that Idid not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky orearth or sea or shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through theregion of the air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that wepassed farther I cannot believe; for the region of fire being betweenthe heaven of the moon and the last region of the air, we could nothave reached that heaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of arewithout being burned; and as we were not burned, either Sancho is lyingor Sancho is dreaming.”“I am neither lying nor dreaming,” said Sancho; “only ask me the tokensof those same goats, and you’ll see by that whether I’m telling thetruth or not.”“Tell us them then, Sancho,” said the duchess.“Two of them,” said Sancho, “are green, two blood-red, two blue, andone a mixture of all colours.”“An odd sort of goat, that,” said the duke; “in this earthly region ofours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.”“That’s very plain,” said Sancho; “of course there must be a differencebetween the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.”“Tell me, Sancho,” said the duke, “did you see any he-goat among thosegoats?”“No, señor,” said Sancho; “but I have heard say that none ever passedthe horns of the moon.”They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for theysaw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving anaccount of everything that went on there, without having ever stirredfrom the garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of theDistressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter notonly for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho somethingto talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, comingclose to his ear, said to him, “Sancho, as you would have us believewhat you saw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw inthe cave of Montesinos; I say no more.”p41e.jpg (38K)CHAPTER XLII.OF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUTTO GOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERSp42a.jpg (120K)Full SizeThe duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and drollresult of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved tocarry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with formaking it all pass for reality. So having laid their plans and giveninstructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho inhis government of the promised island, the next day, that followingClavileño’s flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to goand be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him asfor the showers of May.Sancho made him an obeisance, and said, “Ever since I came down fromheaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little itis, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled inme; for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed,or what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as bigas hazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on thewhole earth? If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever sosmall a bit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I’d ratherhave it than the best island in the world.”“Recollect, Sancho,” said the duke, “I cannot give a bit of heaven, nonot so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favoursof that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I give you,and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, anduncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use youropportunities, you may, with the help of the world’s riches, gain thoseof heaven.”“Well then,” said Sancho, “let the island come; and I’ll try and besuch a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I’ll go to heaven; andit’s not from any craving to quit my own humble condition or bettermyself, but from the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be agovernor.”“If you once make trial of it, Sancho,” said the duke, “you’ll eat yourfingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command andbe obeyed. Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor (as hewill beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), it will beno easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be sore andsorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.”“Señor,” said Sancho, “it is my belief it’s a good thing to be incommand, if it’s only over a drove of cattle.”“May I be buried with you, Sancho,” said the duke, “but you knoweverything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacitypromises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember to-morrow isthe day you must set out for the government of the island, and thisevening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear,and all things requisite for your departure.”“Let them dress me as they like,” said Sancho; “however I’m dressedI’ll be Sancho Panza.”“That’s true,” said the duke; “but one’s dress must be suited to theoffice or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dresslike a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You, Sancho, shall gopartly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island I am givingyou, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters as much as arms.”“Of letters I know but little,” said Sancho, “for I don’t even know theA B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my memory to bea good governor. As for arms, I’ll handle those they give me till Idrop, and then, God be my help!”“With so good a memory,” said the duke, “Sancho cannot go wrong inanything.”Here Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soonSancho was to go to his government, he with the duke’s permission tookhim by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose ofgiving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. Assoon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, andalmost by force made Sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tonethus addressed him: “I give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho,that, before I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward tomeet thee. I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge therecompense of thy services, find myself still waiting for advancement,while thou, before the time, and contrary to all reasonableexpectation, seest thyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires.Some will bribe, beg, solicit, rise early, entreat, persist, withoutattaining the object of their suit; while another comes, and withoutknowing why or wherefore, finds himself invested with the place oroffice so many have sued for; and here it is that the common saying,‘There is good luck as well as bad luck in suits,’ applies. Thou, who,to my thinking, art beyond all doubt a dullard, without early rising ornight watching or taking any trouble, with the mere breath ofknight-errantry that has breathed upon thee, seest thyself without moreado governor of an island, as though it were a mere matter of course.This I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the favour thou hastreceived to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven that disposesmatters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great power theprofession of knight-errantry contains in itself. With a heart, then,inclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to thyCato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide todirect and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea whereinthou art about to ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts arenothing else but a mighty gulf of troubles.“First of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him iswisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.“Secondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to knowthyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine. Ifthou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up likethe frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost,the recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve asthe ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.”“That’s the truth,” said Sancho; “but that was when I was a boy;afterwards when I was something more of a man it was geese I kept, notpigs. But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it; for all whoare governors don’t come of a kingly stock.”“True,” said Don Quixote, “and for that reason those who are not ofnoble origin should take care that the dignity of the office they holdbe accompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed will save themfrom the sneers of malice that no station escapes.“Glory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and be not ashamed of saying thouart peasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one willset himself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather uponbeing one of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner. Countless are they who,born of mean parentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontificaland imperial, and of the truth of this I could give thee instancesenough to weary thee.“Remember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride indoing virtuous actions, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who haveprincely and lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue anacquisition, and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does notpossess.“This being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to seethee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slighthim, but on the contrary to welcome him, entertain him, and make muchof him; for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven (which is notpleased that any should despise what it hath made), and wilt complywith the laws of well-ordered nature.“If thou carriest thy wife with thee (and it is not well for those thatadminister governments to be long without their wives), teach andinstruct her, and strive to smooth down her natural roughness; for allthat may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by aboorish stupid wife.“If perchance thou art left a widower—a thing which may happen—and invirtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not oneto serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy‘won’t have it;’ for verily, I tell thee, for all the judge’s wifereceives, the husband will be held accountable at the general callingto account; where he will have repay in death fourfold, items that inlife he regarded as naught.“Never go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorant menwho plume themselves on cleverness.“Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but notmore justice, than the pleadings of the rich.“Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and presentsof the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.“When equity may and should be brought into play, press not the utmostrigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the sternjudge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.“If perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let it benot by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.“If it should happen to thee to give judgment in the cause of one whois thine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them onthe justice of the case.“Let not thine own passion blind thee in another man’s cause; for theerrors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable; orif not, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even ofthy fortune.“If any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thineeyes from her tears and thine ears from her lamentations, and considerdeliberately the merits of her demand, if thou wouldst not have thyreason swept away by her weeping, and thy rectitude by her sighs.“Abuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed, for the painof punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition ofthine objurgations.“Bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is buta miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved nature,and so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbearing;for though the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyes that ofmercy is brighter and loftier than that of justice.“If thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days will belong, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable;thou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thygrandchildren will bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concordwith all men; and, when life draws to a close, death will come to theein calm and ripe old age, and the light and loving hands of thygreat-grandchildren will close thine eyes.“What I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for theadornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of thebody.”p42e.jpg (17K)CHAPTER XLIII.OF THE SECOND SET OF COUNSELS DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZAp43a.jpg (129K)Full SizeWho, hearing the foregoing discourse of Don Quixote, would not have sethim down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude ofpurpose? But, as has been frequently observed in the course of thisgreat history, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, andin discussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear andunbiassed understanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie tohis intellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in the case of thesesecond counsels that he gave Sancho, he showed himself to have a livelyturn of humour, and displayed conspicuously his wisdom, and also hisfolly.Sancho listened to him with the deepest attention, and endeavoured tofix his counsels in his memory, like one who meant to follow them andby their means bring the full promise of his government to a happyissue. Don Quixote, then, went on to say:“With regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person andthy house, Sancho, the first charge I have to give thee is to be clean,and to cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whose ignorancemakes them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands, as ifthose excrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not the talonsof a lizard-catching kestrel—a filthy and unnatural abuse.“Go not ungirt and loose, Sancho; for disordered attire is a sign of anunstable mind, unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to beset down to craft, as was the common opinion in the case of JuliusCæsar.“Ascertain cautiously what thy office may be worth; and if it willallow thee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable andserviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them betweenthy servants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe sixpages, clothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pagesfor heaven and pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of thisnew mode of giving liveries.“Eat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin bythe smell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way asto make it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation isbad.“Dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of thewhole body is forged in the workshop of the stomach.“Be temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keepsneither secrets nor promises.“Take care, Sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct inanybody’s presence.”“Eruct!” said Sancho; “I don’t know what that means.”“To eruct, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “means to belch, and that is oneof the filthiest words in the Spanish language, though a veryexpressive one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the Latin,and instead of belch say eruct, and instead of belches say eructations;and if some do not understand these terms it matters little, for customwill bring them into use in the course of time, so that they will bereadily understood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom andthe public are all-powerful there.”“In truth, señor,” said Sancho, “one of the counsels and cautions Imean to bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for I’m constantlydoing it.”“Eruct, Sancho, not belch,” said Don Quixote.“Eruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,” saidSancho.“Likewise, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou must not mingle such aquantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for though proverbsare short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the head andshoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.”“God alone can cure that,” said Sancho; “for I have more proverbs in methan a book, and when I speak they come so thick together into my mouththat they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that’s why mytongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat to thepurpose. But I’ll take care henceforward to use such as befit thedignity of my office; for ‘in a house where there’s plenty, supper issoon cooked,’ and ‘he who binds does not wrangle,’ and ‘thebell-ringer’s in a safe berth,’ and ‘giving and keeping requirebrains.’”“That’s it, Sancho!” said Don Quixote; “pack, tack, string proverbstogether; nobody is hindering thee! ‘My mother beats me, and I go onwith my tricks.’ I am bidding thee avoid proverbs, and here in a secondthou hast shot out a whole litany of them, which have as much to dowith what we are talking about as ‘over the hills of Úbeda.’ Mind,Sancho, I do not say that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable;but to pile up and string together proverbs at random makesconversation dull and vulgar.“When thou ridest on horseback, do not go lolling with thy body on theback of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from thehorse’s belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou werton Dapple; for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and groomsof others.“Be moderate in thy sleep; for he who does not rise early does not getthe benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the motherof good fortune, and indolence, its opposite, never yet attained theobject of an honest ambition.“The last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend tobodily improvement, I would have thee carry carefully in thy memory,for I believe it will be no less useful to thee than those I have giventhee already, and it is this—never engage in a dispute about families,at least in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarilyone of those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt behated by the one thou hast disparaged, and get nothing in any shapefrom the one thou hast exalted.“Thy attire shall be hose of full length, a long jerkin, and a cloak atrifle longer; loose breeches by no means, for they are becomingneither for gentlemen nor for governors.“For the present, Sancho, this is all that has occurred to me to advisethee; as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall follow,if thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced.”“Señor,” said Sancho, “I see well enough that all these things yourworship has said to me are good, holy, and profitable; but what usewill they be to me if I don’t remember one of them? To be sure thatabout not letting my nails grow, and marrying again if I have thechance, will not slip out of my head; but all that other hash, muddle,and jumble—I don’t and can’t recollect any more of it than of lastyear’s clouds; so it must be given me in writing; for though I can’teither read or write, I’ll give it to my confessor, to drive it into meand remind me of it whenever it is necessary.”“Ah, sinner that I am!” said Don Quixote, “how bad it looks ingovernors not to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee,Sancho, when a man knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it arguesone of two things; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean andlowly parents, or that he himself was so incorrigible andill-conditioned that neither good company nor good teaching could makeany impression on him. It is a great defect that thou labourest under,and therefore I would have thee learn at any rate to sign thy name.”“I can sign my name well enough,” said Sancho, “for when I was stewardof the brotherhood in my village I learned to make certain letters,like the marks on bales of goods, which they told me made out my name.Besides I can pretend my right hand is disabled and make someone elsesign for me, for ‘there’s a remedy for everything except death;’ and asI shall be in command and hold the staff, I can do as I like; moreover,‘he who has the alcalde for his father—,’ and I’ll be governor, andthat’s higher than alcalde. Only come and see! Let them make light ofme and abuse me; ‘they’ll come for wool and go back shorn;’ ‘whom Godloves, his house is known to Him;’ ‘the silly sayings of the rich passfor saws in the world;’ and as I’ll be rich, being a governor, and atthe same time generous, as I mean to be, no fault will be seen in me.‘Only make yourself honey and the flies will suck you;’ ‘as much asthou hast so much art thou worth,’ as my grandmother used to say; and‘thou canst have no revenge of a man of substance.’”“Oh, God’s curse upon thee, Sancho!” here exclaimed Don Quixote; “sixtythousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs! For the last hourthou hast been stringing them together and inflicting the pangs oftorture on me with every one of them. Those proverbs will bring thee tothe gallows one day, I promise thee; thy subjects will take thegovernment from thee, or there will be revolts among them. Tell me,where dost thou pick them up, thou booby? How dost thou apply them,thou blockhead? For with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, Ihave to sweat and labour as if I were digging.”“By God, master mine,” said Sancho, “your worship is making a fussabout very little. Why the devil should you be vexed if I make use ofwhat is my own? And I have got nothing else, nor any other stock intrade except proverbs and more proverbs; and here are three just thisinstant come into my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in abasket; but I won’t repeat them, for ‘sage silence is called Sancho.’”“That, Sancho, thou art not,” said Don Quixote; “for not only art thounot sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate and perversity; still Iwould like to know what three proverbs have just now come into thymemory, for I have been turning over mine own—and it is a good one—andnone occurs to me.”“What can be better,” said Sancho, “than ‘never put thy thumbs betweentwo back teeth;’ and ‘to “_get out of my house_” and “_what do you wantwith my wife?_” there is no answer;’ and ‘whether the pitcher hits thestone, or the stone the pitcher, it’s a bad business for the pitcher;’all which fit to a hair? For no one should quarrel with his governor,or him in authority over him, because he will come off the worst, as hedoes who puts his finger between two back and if they are not backteeth it makes no difference, so long as they are teeth; and towhatever the governor may say there’s no answer, any more than to ‘getout of my house’ and ‘what do you want with my wife?’ and then, as forthat about the stone and the pitcher, a blind man could see that. Sothat he ‘who sees the mote in another’s eye had need to see the beam inhis own,’ that it be not said of himself, ‘the dead woman wasfrightened at the one with her throat cut;’ and your worship knows wellthat ‘the fool knows more in his own house than the wise man inanother’s.’”“Nay, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “the fool knows nothing, either in hisown house or in anybody else’s, for no wise structure of any sort canstand on a foundation of folly; but let us say no more about it,Sancho, for if thou governest badly, thine will be the fault and minethe shame; but I comfort myself with having done my duty in advisingthee as earnestly and as wisely as I could; and thus I am released frommy obligations and my promise. God guide thee, Sancho, and govern theein thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have that thouwilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily preventby explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all thatfat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbsand sauciness.”“Señor,” said Sancho, “if your worship thinks I’m not fit for thisgovernment, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black of the nail ofmy soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live just aswell, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on partridgesand capons; and what’s more, while we’re asleep we’re all equal, greatand small, rich and poor. But if your worship looks into it, you willsee it was your worship alone that put me on to this business ofgoverning; for I know no more about the government of islands than abuzzard; and if there’s any reason to think that because of my being agovernor the devil will get hold of me, I’d rather go Sancho to heaventhan governor to hell.”“By God, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for those last words thou hastuttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousandislands. Thou hast good natural instincts, without which no knowledgeis worth anything; commend thyself to God, and try not to swerve in thepursuit of thy main object; I mean, always make it thy aim and fixedpurpose to do right in all matters that come before thee, for heavenalways helps good intentions; and now let us go to dinner, for I thinkmy lord and lady are waiting for us.”p43e.jpg (41K)CHAPTER XLIV.HOW SANCHO PANZA WAS CONDUCTED TO HIS GOVERNMENT, AND OF THE STRANGEADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLEp44a.jpg (140K)Full SizeIt is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that whenCide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did nottranslate it as he wrote it—that is, as a kind of complaint the Moormade against himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of solittle variety as this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced tospeak perpetually of him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge indigressions and episodes more serious and more interesting. He said,too, that to go on, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing uponone single subject, and speaking through the mouths of a fewcharacters, was intolerable drudgery, the result of which was neverequal to the author’s labour, and that to avoid this he had in theFirst Part availed himself of the device of novels, like “TheIll-advised Curiosity,” and “The Captive Captain,” which stand, as itwere, apart from the story; the others are given there being incidentswhich occurred to Don Quixote himself and could not be omitted. He alsothought, he says, that many, engrossed by the interest attaching to theexploits of Don Quixote, would take none in the novels, and pass themover hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance and art oftheir composition, which would be very manifest were they published bythemselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of Don Quixote or thesimplicities of Sancho. Therefore in this Second Part he thought itbest not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but onlyepisodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances thefacts present; and even these sparingly, and with no more words thansuffice to make them plain; and as he confines and restricts himself tothe narrow limits of the narrative, though he has ability; capacity,and brains enough to deal with the whole universe, he requests that hislabours may not be despised, and that credit be given him, not alonefor what he writes, but for what he has refrained from writing.And so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gavethe counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed themto him in writing so that he might get someone to read them to him.They had scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop,and they fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to theduchess and they were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of DonQuixote. To carry on the joke, then, the same evening they despatchedSancho with a large following to the village that was to serve him foran island. It happened that the person who had him in charge was amajordomo of the duke’s, a man of great discretion and humour—and therecan be no humour without discretion—and the same who played the part ofthe Countess Trifaldi in the comical way that has been alreadydescribed; and thus qualified, and instructed by his master andmistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he carried out their schemeadmirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as Sancho saw thismajordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of the Trifaldi,and turning to his master, he said to him, “Señor, either the devilwill carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing, or yourworship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the duke’shere is the very face of the Distressed One.”Don Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so,said to Sancho, “There is no reason why the devil should carry theeoff, Sancho, either righteous or believing—and what thou meanest bythat I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of themajordomo, but for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One;for his being so would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is notthe time for going into questions of the sort, which would be involvingourselves in an inextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we mustpray earnestly to our Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizardsand enchanters.”“It is no joke, señor,” said Sancho, “for before this I heard himspeak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi wassounding in my ears. Well, I’ll hold my peace; but I’ll take care to beon the look-out henceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm ordo away with this suspicion.”“Thou wilt do well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and thou wilt let meknow all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thygovernment.”Sancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. He wasdressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camletover all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a lagineta upon a mule. Behind him, in accordance with the duke’s orders,followed Dapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, andfrom time to time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so wellpleased to have him with him that he would not have changed places withthe emperor of Germany. On taking leave he kissed the hands of the dukeand duchess and got his master’s blessing, which Don Quixote gave himwith tears, and he received blubbering.p44b.jpg (341K)Full SizeLet worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, Gentle Reader; andlook out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how hebehaved himself in office will give thee. In the meantime turn thyattention to what happened his master the same night, and if thou dostnot laugh thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin;for Don Quixote’s adventures must be honoured either with wonder orwith laughter.It is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felthis loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandateand take away the government from him he would have done so. Theduchess observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy;because, she said, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there weresquires, duennas, and damsels in her house who would wait upon him tohis full satisfaction.“The truth is, señora,” replied Don Quixote, “that I do feel the lossof Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of allthe offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will withwhich they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of yourexcellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in mychamber.”“Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that must not be; fourof my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.”“To me,” said Don Quixote, “they will not be flowers, but thorns topierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter mychamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still further,though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait uponmyself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinationsand my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through thegenerosity your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, inshort, I will sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undressme.”“Say no more, Señor Don Quixote, say no more,” said the duchess; “Iassure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel,shall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine the propriety ofSeñor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues theone that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship may undressand dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when youplease, for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber youwill find all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one whosleeps with his door locked, to the end that no natural needs compelyou to open it. May the great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousandyears, and may her fame extend all over the surface of the globe, forshe deserves to be loved by a knight so valiant and so virtuous; andmay kind heaven infuse zeal into the heart of our governor Sancho Panzato finish off his discipline speedily, so that the world may once moreenjoy the beauty of so grand a lady.”To which Don Quixote replied, “Your highness has spoken like what youare; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcineawill be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise ofyour highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earthcould bestow upon her.”“Well, well, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, it is nearlysupper-time, and the duke is probably waiting; come let us go tosupper, and retire to rest early, for the journey you made yesterdayfrom Kandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused yousome fatigue.”“I feel none, señora,” said Don Quixote, “for I would go so far as toswear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounted a quieterbeast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavileño; and I don’t know whatcould have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and sogentle, and burn it so recklessly as he did.”“Probably,” said the duchess, “repenting of the evil he had done to theTrifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he must have committedas a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away with all theinstruments of his craft; and so burned Clavileño as the chief one, andthat which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land; andby its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great DonQuixote of La Mancha is established for ever.”Don Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped,retired to his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter withhim to wait on him, such was his fear of encountering temptations thatmight lead or drive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his ladyDulcinea; for he had always present to his mind the virtue of Amadis,that flower and mirror of knights-errant. He locked the door behindhim, and by the light of two wax candles undressed himself, but as hewas taking off his stockings—O disaster unworthy of such apersonage!—there came a burst, not of sighs, or anything belying hisdelicacy or good breeding, but of some two dozen stitches in one of hisstockings, that made it look like a window-lattice. The worthygentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at that moment he wouldhave given an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silkthere; I say green silk, because the stockings were green.Here Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, “O poverty, poverty! Iknow not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee‘holy gift ungratefully received.’ Although a Moor, I know well enoughfrom the intercourse I have had with Christians that holiness consistsin charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all that,I say he must have a great deal of godliness who can find anysatisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of povertyone of their greatest saints refers to, saying, ‘possess all things asthough ye possessed them not;’ which is what they call poverty inspirit. But thou, that other poverty—for it is of thee I am speakingnow—why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of good birthmore than with other people? Why dost thou compel them to smear thecracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, onesilk, another hair, and another glass? Why must their ruffs be alwayscrinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?”(From this we may perceive the antiquity of starch and crimped ruffs.)Then he goes on: “Poor gentleman of good family! always cockering uphis honour, dining miserably and in secret, and making a hypocrite ofthe toothpick with which he sallies out into the street after eatingnothing to oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say, with his nervoushonour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his shoe, thesweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and the hunger ofhis stomach!”All this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of hisstitches; however, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho hadleft behind a pair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear thenext day. At last he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, asmuch because he missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster tohis stockings, the stitches of which he would have even taken up withsilk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty agentleman can show in the course of his never-failing embarrassments.He put out the candles; but the night was warm and he could not sleep;he rose from his bed and opened slightly a grated window that lookedout on a beautiful garden, and as he did so he perceived and heardpeople walking and talking in the garden. He set himself to listenattentively, and those below raised their voices so that he could hearthese words:“Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since thisstranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing butonly weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, andI would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; andeven if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain,if this strange Æneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me,sleeps on and wakens not to hear it.”“Heed not that, dear Altisidora,” replied a voice; “the duchess is nodoubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart anddisturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the gratedwindow of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, ina low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if theduchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.”“That is not the point, Emerencia,” replied Altisidora, “it is that Iwould not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I shouldbe thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mightypower of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than asore in the heart;” and here a harp softly touched made itself heard.As he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathlessamazement, for immediately the countless adventures like this, withwindows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings,that he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind.He at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess’s was in love withhim, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. Hetrembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution not toyield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his ladyDulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let themknow he was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels werenot a little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote shouldhear them. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her handacross the strings, began this ballad:O thou that art above in bed,    Between the holland sheets,A-lying there from night till morn,    With outstretched legs asleep;O thou, most valiant knight of all    The famed Manchegan breed,Of purity and virtue more    Than gold of Araby;Give ear unto a suffering maid,    Well-grown but evil-starr’d,For those two suns of thine have lit    A fire within her heart.Adventures seeking thou dost rove,    To others bringing woe;Thou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm    To heal them dost withhold!Say, valiant youth, and so may God    Thy enterprises speed,Didst thou the light mid Libya’s sands    Or Jaca’s rocks first see?Did scaly serpents give thee suck?    Who nursed thee when a babe?Wert cradled in the forest rude,    Or gloomy mountain cave?O Dulcinea may be proud,    That plump and lusty maid;For she alone hath had the power    A tiger fierce to tame.And she for this shall famous be    From Tagus to Jarama,From Manzanares to Genil,    From Duero to Arlanza.Fain would I change with her, and give    A petticoat to boot,The best and bravest that I have,    All trimmed with gold galloon.O for to be the happy fair    Thy mighty arms enfold,Or even sit beside thy bed    And scratch thy dusty poll!I rave,—to favours such as these    Unworthy to aspire;Thy feet to tickle were enough    For one so mean as I.What caps, what slippers silver-laced,    Would I on thee bestow!What damask breeches make for thee;    What fine long holland cloaks!And I would give thee pearls that should    As big as oak-galls show;So matchless big that each might well    Be called the great “Alone.”Manchegan Nero, look not down    From thy Tarpeian RockUpon this burning heart, nor add    The fuel of thy wrath.A virgin soft and young am I,    Not yet fifteen years old;(I’m only three months past fourteen,    I swear upon my soul).I hobble not nor do I limp,    All blemish I’m without,And as I walk my lily locks    Are trailing on the ground.And though my nose be rather flat,    And though my mouth be wide,My teeth like topazes exalt    My beauty to the sky.Thou knowest that my voice is sweet,    That is if thou dost hear;And I am moulded in a form    Somewhat below the mean.These charms, and many more, are thine,    Spoils to thy spear and bow all;A damsel of this house am I,    By name Altisidora.p44c.jpg (266K)Full SizeHere the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while thewarmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh hesaid to himself, “O that I should be such an unlucky knight that nodamsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! O that thepeerless Dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let herenjoy my incomparable constancy in peace! What would ye with her, yequeens? Why do ye persecute her, ye empresses? Why ye pursue her, yevirgins of from fourteen to fifteen? Leave the unhappy being totriumph, rejoice and glory in the lot love has been pleased to bestowupon her in surrendering my heart and yielding up my soul to her. Yelove-smitten host, know that to Dulcinea only I am dough andsugar-paste, flint to all others; for her I am honey, for you aloes.For me Dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise, virtuous, graceful, andhigh-bred, and all others are ill-favoured, foolish, light, andlow-born. Nature sent me into the world to be hers and no other’s;Altisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake they belaboured mein the castle of the enchanted Moor may give way to despair, but I mustbe Dulcinea’s, boiled or roast, pure, courteous, and chaste, in spiteof all the magic-working powers on earth.” And with that he shut thewindow with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of sorts as ifsome great misfortune had befallen him, stretched himself on his bed,where we will leave him for the present, as the great Sancho Panza, whois about to set up his famous government, now demands our attention.p44e.jpg (145K)Full SizeCHAPTER XLV.OF HOW THE GREAT SANCHO PANZA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS ISLAND, AND OF HOWHE MADE A BEGINNING IN GOVERNINGp45a.jpg (141K)Full SizeO perpetual discoverer of the antipodes, torch of the world, eye ofheaven, sweet stimulator of the water-coolers! Thimbraeus here, Phœbusthere, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music;thou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, neversettest! To thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee Iappeal to help me and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be ableto proceed with scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the greatSancho Panza’s government; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble,and uncertain.To come to the point, then—Sancho with all his attendants arrived at avillage of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the dukepossessed. They informed him that it was called the island ofBarataria, either because the name of the village was Baratario, orbecause of the joke by way of which the government had been conferredupon him. On reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one,the municipality came forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, andthe inhabitants showed every sign of general satisfaction; and withgreat pomp they conducted him to the principal church to give thanks toGod, and then with burlesque ceremonies they presented him with thekeys of the town, and acknowledged him as perpetual governor of theisland of Barataria. The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figureof the new governor astonished all those who were not in on the secret,and even all who were, and they were not a few. Finally, leading himout of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated himon it, and the duke’s majordomo said to him, “It is an ancient customin this island, señor governor, that he who comes to take possession ofthis famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put tohim, and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by hisanswer the people take the measure of their new governor’s wit, andhail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.”While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at severallarge letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he couldnot read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. Theanswer was, “Señor, there is written and recorded the day on which yourlordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says,‘This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Señor DonSancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoyit.’”“And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?” asked Sancho.“Your lordship,” replied the majordomo; “for no other Panza but the onewho is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.”“Well then, let me tell you, brother,” said Sancho, “I haven’t got the‘Don,’ nor has anyone of my family ever had it; my name is plain SanchoPanza, and Sancho was my father’s name, and Sancho was my grandfather’sand they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Doñas tacked on; Isuspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but nevermind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four daysI’ll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as themidges, they’re so plenty. Let the majordomo go on with his question,and I’ll give the best answer I can, whether the people deplore ornot.”At this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a caneby way of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, “Señor,some time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratifyhim and do him a service, on the condition that he was to return themto me whenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I askedfor them, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return themthan he was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growingcareless about payment I asked for them once and several times; and notonly will he not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, andsays I never lent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaidthem; and I have no witnesses either of the loan, or the payment, forhe never paid me; I want your worship to put him to his oath, and if heswears he returned them to me I forgive him the debt here and beforeGod.”p45b.jpg (400K)Full Size“What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?” said Sancho.To which the old man replied, “I admit, señor, that he lent them to me;but let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath,I’ll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.”The governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who hadthe stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while heswore, as if he found it in his way; and then laid his hand on thecross of the staff, saying that it was true the ten crowns that weredemanded of him had been lent him; but that he had with his own handgiven them back into the hand of the other, and that he, notrecollecting it, was always asking for them.Seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had tomake to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor hadtold the truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a goodChristian, and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had givenhim back the crowns; and that from that time forth he would make nofurther demand upon him.The debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court.Observing this, and how, without another word, he made off, andobserving too the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his headin his bosom and remained for a short space in deep thought, with theforefinger of his right hand on his brow and nose; then he raised hishead and bade them call back the old man with the stick, for he hadalready taken his departure. They brought him back, and as soon asSancho saw him he said, “Honest man, give me that stick, for I wantit.”“Willingly,” said the old man; “here it is señor,” and he put it intohis hand.Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, “Go,and God be with you; for now you are paid.”“I, señor!” returned the old man; “why, is this cane worth tengold-crowns?”“Yes,” said the governor, “or if not I am the greatest dolt in theworld; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern awhole kingdom;” and he ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, inthe presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it they foundten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon theirgovernor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to theconclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, thatobserving how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponentwhile he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and trulygiven him the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he askedfor the stick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded mustbe inside it; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimesguides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may befools; besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mentionjust such another case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was notthat he forgot everything he wished to remember, there would not besuch a memory in all the island. To conclude, the old men went off, onecrestfallen, and the other in high contentment, all who were presentwere astonished, and he who was recording the words, deeds, andmovements of Sancho could not make up his mind whether he was to lookupon him and set him down as a fool or as a man of sense.As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a womanholding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattledealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming,“Justice, señor governor, justice! and if I don’t get it on earth I’llgo look for it in heaven. Señor governor of my soul, this wicked mancaught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if itwas an ill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had keptthese three-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors andChristians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, andkeeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among thebrambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handleme!”“It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,”said Sancho; and turning to the man he asked him what he had to say inanswer to the woman’s charge.He all in confusion made answer, “Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, andthis morning I left the village to sell (saving your presence) fourpigs, and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little lessthan the worth of them. As I was returning to my village I fell in onthe road with this good dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a messout of everything, yoked us together. I paid her fairly, but she notcontented laid hold of me and never let go until she brought me here;she says I forced her, but she lies by the oath I swear or am ready toswear; and this is the whole truth and every particle of it.”The governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him;he said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. Thegovernor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyedtrembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all andpraying to God for the long life and health of the señor governor whohad such regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out ofcourt with the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however,to see if the money it contained was silver.As soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tearswere already starting and whose eyes and heart were following hispurse, “Good fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her,by force even, and come back with it here;” and he did not say it toone who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash oflightning, and ran to do as he was bid.All the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, andpresently both man and woman came back at even closer grips thanbefore, she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, andhe struggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stoutwas the woman’s defence, she all the while crying out, “Justice fromGod and the world! see here, señor governor, the shamelessness andboldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middleof the street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade himgive me.”“And did he take it?” asked the governor.“Take it!” said the woman; “I’d let my life be taken from me soonerthan the purse. A pretty child I’d be! It’s another sort of cat theymust throw in my face, and not that poor scurvy knave. Pincers andhammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip; no, norlions’ claws; the soul from out of my body first!”“She is right,” said the man; “I own myself beaten and powerless; Iconfess I haven’t the strength to take it from her;” and he let go hishold of her.Upon this the governor said to the woman, “Let me see that purse, myworthy and sturdy friend.” She handed it to him at once, and thegovernor returned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress offorce, “Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much, spiritand vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending thatpurse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Be off, andGod speed you, and bad luck to you, and don’t show your face in allthis island, or within six leagues of it on any side, under pain of twohundred lashes; be off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.”The woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her head; andthe governor said to the man, “Honest man, go home with your money, andGod speed you; and for the future, if you don’t want to lose it, seethat you don’t take it into your head to yoke with anybody.” The manthanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way, and thebystanders were again filled with admiration at their new governor’sjudgments and sentences.Next, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor,for he had a pair of shears in his hand, presented themselves beforehim, and the tailor said, “Señor governor, this labourer and I comebefore your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shopyesterday (for saving everybody’s presence I’m a passed tailor, God bethanked), and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me,‘Señor, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?’ Measuringthe cloth I said there would. He probably suspected—as I supposed, andI supposed right—that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to thinkso by his own roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors; andhe told me to see if there would be enough for two. I guessed what hewould be at, and I said ‘yes.’ He, still following up his originalunworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap, and I ‘yes’ after ‘yes,’until we got as far as five. He has just this moment come for them; Igave them to him, but he won’t pay me for the making; on the contrary,he calls upon me to pay him, or else return his cloth.”“Is all this true, brother?” said Sancho.“Yes,” replied the man; “but will your worship make him show the fivecaps he has made me?”“With all my heart,” said the tailor; and drawing his hand from underhis cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it, andsaid, “there are the caps this good man asks for; and by God and uponmy conscience I haven’t a scrap of cloth left, and I’ll let the work beexamined by the inspectors of the trade.”All present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit;Sancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, “It seems tome that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-windedarguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; andso my decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer thecloth, and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let therebe no more about it.”If the previous decision about the cattle dealer’s purse excited theadmiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however,the governor’s orders were after all executed. All this, having beentaken down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, whowas looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave thegood Sancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora’smusic, has pressing claims upon us now.p45e.jpg (11K)CHAPTER XLVI.OF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSEOF THE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA’S WOOINGp46a.jpg (58K)Full SizeWe left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music ofthe enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed withthem, and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get amoment’s rest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them.But as Time is fleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he cameriding on the hours, and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which DonQuixote quitted the soft down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself inhis chamois suit and put on his travelling boots to hide the disasterto his stockings. He threw over him his scarlet mantle, put on his heada montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across hisshoulder the baldric with his good trenchant sword, took up a largerosary that he always carried with him, and with great solemnity andprecision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke andduchess were already dressed and waiting for him. But as he passedthrough a gallery, Altisidora and the other damsel, her friend, werelying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora saw him she pretendedto faint, while her friend caught her in her lap, and began hastilyunlacing the bosom of her dress.Don Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, “I know very wellwhat this seizure arises from.”“I know not from what,” replied the friend, “for Altisidora is thehealthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never heard hercomplain all the time I have known her. A plague on all theknights-errant in the world, if they be all ungrateful! Go away, SeñorDon Quixote; for this poor child will not come to herself again so longas you are here.”p46b.jpg (320K)Full SizeTo which Don Quixote returned, “Do me the favour, señora, to let a lutebe placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maidento the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a promptdisillusion is an approved remedy;” and with this he retired, so as notto be remarked by any who might see him there.He had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her swoon,said to her companion, “The lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixoteintends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad.”They went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and ofthe lute Don Quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure,plotted with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick thatshould be amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night,which came quickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the dukeand duchess spent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote.When eleven o’clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his chamber; hetried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons werewalking in the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets ofthe guitar and tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared hischest, and then with a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sangthe following ballad, which he had himself that day composed:Mighty Love the hearts of maidensDoth unsettle and perplex,And the instrument he usesMost of all is idleness.Sewing, stitching, any labour,Having always work to do,To the poison Love instillethIs the antidote most sure.And to proper-minded maidensWho desire the matron’s nameModesty’s a marriage portion,Modesty their highest praise.Men of prudence and discretion,Courtiers gay and gallant knights,With the wanton damsels dally,But the modest take to wife.There are passions, transient, fleeting,Loves in hostelries declar’d,Sunrise loves, with sunset ended,When the guest hath gone his way.Love that springs up swift and sudden,Here to-day, to-morrow flown,Passes, leaves no trace behind it,Leaves no image on the soul.Painting that is laid on paintingMaketh no display or show;Where one beauty’s in possessionThere no other can take hold.Dulcinea del TobosoPainted on my heart I wear;Never from its tablets, never,Can her image be eras’d.The quality of all in loversMost esteemed is constancy;’Tis by this that love works wonders,This exalts them to the skies.Don Quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, theduchess, Altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle werelistening, when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactlyover his window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bellsattached to it, and immediately after that discharged a great sack fullof cats, which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. Suchwas the din of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though theduke and duchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled byit, while Don Quixote stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would haveit, two or three of the cats made their way in through the grating ofhis chamber, and flying from one side to the other, made it seem as ifthere was a legion of devils at large in it. They extinguished thecandles that were burning in the room, and rushed about seeking someway of escape; the cord with the large bells never ceased rising andfalling; and most of the people of the castle, not knowing what wasreally the matter, were at their wits’ end with astonishment. DonQuixote sprang to his feet, and drawing his sword, began making passesat the grating, shouting out, “Avaunt, malignant enchanters! avaunt, yewitchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, against whomyour evil machinations avail not nor have any power.” And turning uponthe cats that were running about the room, he made several cuts atthem. They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, save one that,finding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote’s sword, flewat his face and held on to his nose tooth and nail, with the pain ofwhich he began to shout his loudest. The duke and duchess hearing this,and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his room, and as thepoor gentleman was striving with all his might to detach the cat fromhis face, they opened the door with a master-key and went in withlights and witnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran forward to partthe combatants, but Don Quixote cried out aloud, “Let no one take himfrom me; leave me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, thisenchanter; I will teach him, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Manchais.” The cat, however, never minding these threats, snarled and heldon; but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window.Don Quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nosenot in very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let himfinish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain ofan enchanter. They sent for some oil of John’s wort, and Altisidoraherself with her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts; and asshe did so she said to him in a low voice. “All these mishaps havebefallen thee, hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility andobstinacy; and God grant thy squire Sancho may forget to whip himself,so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be releasedfrom her enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at leastwhile I who adore thee am alive.”To all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, andthen stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess fortheir kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringingrabble of enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their goodintentions in coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him torepose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of thejoke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy onDon Quixote or cost him so dear, for it cost him five days ofconfinement to his bed, during which he had another adventure,pleasanter than the late one, which his chronicler will not relate justnow in order that he may turn his attention to Sancho Panza, who wasproceeding with great diligence and drollery in his government.p46e.jpg (65K)CHAPTER XLVII.WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW SANCHO PANZA CONDUCTED HIMSELFIN HIS GOVERNMENTp47a.jpg (139K)Full SizeThe history says that from the justice court they carried Sancho to asumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laidout with royal magnificence. The clarions sounded as Sancho entered theroom, and four pages came forward to present him with water for hishands, which Sancho received with great dignity. The music ceased, andSancho seated himself at the head of the table, for there was only thatseat placed, and no more than one cover laid. A personage, who itappeared afterwards was a physician, placed himself standing by hisside with a whalebone wand in his hand. They then lifted up a finewhite cloth covering fruit and a great variety of dishes of differentsorts; one who looked like a student said grace, and a page put a lacedbib on Sancho, while another who played the part of head carver placeda dish of fruit before him. But hardly had he tasted a morsel when theman with the wand touched the plate with it, and they took it away frombefore him with the utmost celerity. The carver, however, brought himanother dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it; but before he could getat it, not to say taste it, already the wand had touched it and a pagehad carried it off with the same promptitude as the fruit. Sanchoseeing this was puzzled, and looking from one to another asked if thisdinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery trick.To this he with the wand replied, “It is not to be eaten, señorgovernor, except as is usual and customary in other islands where thereare governors. I, señor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in thisisland to serve its governors as such, and I have a much greater regardfor their health than for my own, studying day and night and makingmyself acquainted with the governor’s constitution, in order to be ableto cure him when he falls sick. The chief thing I have to do is toattend at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears tome to be fit for him, and keep from him what I think will do him harmand be injurious to his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate offruit to be removed as being too moist, and that other dish I orderedto be removed as being too hot and containing many spices thatstimulate thirst; for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radicalmoisture wherein life consists.”“Well then,” said Sancho, “that dish of roast partridges there thatseems so savoury will not do me any harm.”To this the physician replied, “Of those my lord the governor shall noteat so long as I live.”“Why so?” said Sancho.“Because,” replied the doctor, “our master Hippocrates, the polestarand beacon of medicine, says in one of his aphorisms _omnis saturatiomala, perdicis autem pessima_, which means ‘all repletion is bad, butthat of partridge is the worst of all.”“In that case,” said Sancho, “let señor doctor see among the dishesthat are on the table what will do me most good and least harm, and letme eat it, without tapping it with his stick; for by the life of thegovernor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I’m dying ofhunger; and in spite of the doctor and all he may say, to deny me foodis the way to take my life instead of prolonging it.”“Your worship is right, señor governor,” said the physician; “andtherefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of those stewedrabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that veal werenot roasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is out ofthe question.”“That big dish that is smoking farther off,” said Sancho, “seems to meto be an olla podrida, and out of the diversity of things in suchollas, I can’t fail to light upon something tasty and good for me.”p47b.jpg (372K)Full Size“_Absit_,” said the doctor; “far from us be any such base thought!There is nothing in the world less nourishing than an olla podrida; tocanons, or rectors of colleges, or peasants’ weddings with your ollaspodridas, but let us have none of them on the tables of governors,where everything that is present should be delicate and refined; andthe reason is, that always, everywhere and by everybody, simplemedicines are more esteemed than compound ones, for we cannot go wrongin those that are simple, while in the compound we may, by merelyaltering the quantity of the things composing them. But what I am ofopinion the governor should eat now in order to preserve and fortifyhis health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices ofconserve of quinces, which will settle his stomach and help hisdigestion.”Sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed thedoctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was andwhere he had studied.He replied, “My name, señor governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero Iam a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracueland Almodóvar del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degreeof doctor from the university of Osuna.”To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, “Then let DoctorPedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that’s on theright-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almodóvar del Campo, graduateof Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I’lltake a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I’ll not leavea doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant;for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence andhonour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out ofthis or I’ll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over hishead. And if they call me to account for it, I’ll clear myself bysaying I served God in killing a bad doctor—a general executioner. Andnow give me something to eat, or else take your government; for a tradethat does not feed its master is not worth two beans.”The doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, andhe would have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the sameinstant a post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting hishead out of the window turned round and said, “It’s a courier from mylord the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.”The courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper fromhis bosom, placed it in the governor’s hands. Sancho handed it to themajordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus:_To Don Sancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his ownhands or those of his secretary._Sancho when he heard this said, “Which of you is my secretary?” “I am,señor,” said one of those present, “for I can read and write, and am aBiscayan.” “With that addition,” said Sancho, “you might be secretaryto the emperor himself; open this paper and see what it says.” Thenew-born secretary obeyed, and having read the contents said the matterwas one to be discussed in private. Sancho ordered the chamber to becleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so the doctor andthe others withdrew, and then the secretary read the letter, which wasas follows:It has come to my knowledge, Señor Don Sancho Panza, that certainenemies of mine and of the island are about to make a furious attackupon it some night, I know not when. It behoves you to be on the alertand keep watch, that they surprise you not. I also know by trustworthyspies that four persons have entered the town in disguise in order totake your life, because they stand in dread of your great capacity;keep your eyes open and take heed who approaches you to address you,and eat nothing that is presented to you. I will take care to send youaid if you find yourself in difficulty, but in all things you will actas may be expected of your judgment. From this place, the Sixteenth ofAugust, at four in the morning.Your friend,THE DUKESancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be sotoo, and turning to the majordomo he said to him, “What we have got todo first, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in thelock-up; for if anyone wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow deathand the worst of all, which is hunger.”“Likewise,” said the carver, “it is my opinion your worship should noteat anything that is on this table, for the whole was a present fromsome nuns; and as they say, ‘behind the cross there’s the devil.’”“I don’t deny it,” said Sancho; “so for the present give me a piece ofbread and four pounds or so of grapes; no poison can come in them; forthe fact is I can’t go on without eating; and if we are to be preparedfor these battles that are threatening us we must be well provisioned;for it is the tripes that carry the heart and not the heart the tripes.And you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him that all hiscommands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from meto my lady the duchess that I kiss her hands, and that I beg of her notto forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by amessenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail toserve her in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about ityou may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master Don Quixote that he maysee I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayanyou may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and nowtake away this cloth and give me something to eat, and I’ll be ready tomeet all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come againstme or my island.”At this instant a page entered saying, “Here is a farmer on business,who wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, hesays.”“It’s very odd,” said Sancho, “the ways of these men on business; is itpossible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this isno hour for coming on business? We who govern and we who are judges—arewe not men of flesh and blood, and are we not to be allowed the timerequired for taking rest, unless they’d have us made of marble? By Godand on my conscience, if the government remains in my hands (which Ihave a notion it won’t), I’ll bring more than one man on business toorder. However, tell this good man to come in; but take care first ofall that he is not some spy or one of my assassins.”“No, my lord,” said the page, “for he looks like a simple fellow, andeither I know very little or he is as good as good bread.”“There is nothing to be afraid of,” said the majordomo, “for we are allhere.”“Would it be possible, carver,” said Sancho, “now that Doctor PedroRecio is not here, to let me eat something solid and substantial, if itwere even a piece of bread and an onion?”“To-night at supper,” said the carver, “the shortcomings of the dinnershall be made good, and your lordship shall be fully contented.”“God grant it,” said Sancho.The farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see athousand leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The firstthing he said was, “Which is the lord governor here?”“Which should it be,” said the secretary, “but he who is seated in thechair?”“Then I humble myself before him,” said the farmer; and going on hisknees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and badehim stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then said,“I am a farmer, señor, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leaguesfrom Ciudad Real.”“Another Tirteafuera!” said Sancho; “say on, brother; I knowMiguelturra very well I can tell you, for it’s not very far from my owntown.”“The case is this, señor,” continued the farmer, “that by God’s mercy Iam married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman CatholicChurch; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying tobecome bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for mywife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her on myhands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it hadpleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would haveput him to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers thebachelor and the licentiate.”“So that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you wouldnot now be a widower,” said Sancho.“No, señor, certainly not,” said the farmer.“We’ve got that much settled,” said Sancho; “get on, brother, for it’smore bed-time than business-time.”“Well then,” said the farmer, “this son of mine who is going to be abachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called ClaraPerlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and thisname of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, butbecause all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they callthem Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as anOriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her onthe right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants aneye that she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly anddeeply pitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there,but the graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is socleanly that not to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, asthey say, so that one would fancy it was running away from her mouth;and with all this she looks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth;and but for wanting ten or a dozen teeth and grinders she might compareand compete with the comeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they areso fine and thin that, if lips might be reeled, one might make a skeinof them; but being of a different colour from ordinary lips they arewonderful, for they are mottled, blue, green, and purple—let my lordthe governor pardon me for painting so minutely the charms of her whosome time or other will be my daughter; for I love her, and I don’tfind her amiss.”“Paint what you will,” said Sancho; “I enjoy your painting, and if Ihad dined there could be no dessert more to my taste than yourportrait.”“That I have still to furnish,” said the farmer; “but a time will comewhen we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you, señor, if Icould paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it would astonishyou; but that is impossible because she is bent double with her kneesup to her mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if she couldstand up she’d knock her head against the ceiling; and she would havegiven her hand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can’t stretch itout, for it’s contracted; but still one can see its elegance and finemake by its long furrowed nails.”“That will do, brother,” said Sancho; “consider you have painted herfrom head to foot; what is it you want now? Come to the point withoutall this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.”“I want your worship, señor,” said the farmer, “to do me the favour ofgiving me a letter of recommendation to the girl’s father, begging himto be so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are notill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tellthe truth, señor governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there isnot a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; andfrom having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up likea piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but hehas the disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring andpummelling himself he’d be a saint.”“Is there anything else you want, good man?” said Sancho.“There’s another thing I’d like,” said the farmer, “but I’m afraid tomention it; however, out it must; for after all I can’t let it berotting in my breast, come what may. I mean, señor, that I’d like yourworship to give me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to mybachelor’s portion, to help him in setting up house; for they must, inshort, live by themselves, without being subject to the interferencesof their fathers-in-law.”“Just see if there’s anything else you’d like,” said Sancho, “and don’thold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty.”“No, indeed there is not,” said the farmer.The moment he said this the governor started to his feet, and seizingthe chair he had been sitting on exclaimed, “By all that’s good, youill-bred, boorish Don Bumpkin, if you don’t get out of this at once andhide yourself from my sight, I’ll lay your head open with this chair.You whoreson rascal, you devil’s own painter, and is it at this houryou come to ask me for six hundred ducats! How should I have them, youstinking brute? And why should I give them to you if I had them, youknave and blockhead? What have I to do with Miguelturra or the wholefamily of the Perlerines? Get out I say, or by the life of my lord theduke I’ll do as I said. You’re not from Miguelturra, but some knavesent here from hell to tempt me. Why, you villain, I have not yet hadthe government half a day, and you want me to have six hundred ducatsalready!”The carver made signs to the farmer to leave the room, which he didwith his head down, and to all appearance in terror lest the governorshould carry his threats into effect, for the rogue knew very well howto play his part.But let us leave Sancho in his wrath, and peace be with them all; andlet us return to Don Quixote, whom we left with his face bandaged anddoctored after the cat wounds, of which he was not cured for eightdays; and on one of these there befell him what Cide Hamete promises torelate with that exactitude and truth with which he is wont to setforth everything connected with this great history, however minute itmay be.p47e.jpg (12K)CHAPTER XLVIII.OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH DOÑA RODRIGUEZ, THE DUCHESS’S DUENNA,TOGETHER WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY OF RECORD AND ETERNALREMEMBRANCEp48a.jpg (131K)Full SizeExceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, withhis face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the clawsof a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.p48b.jpg (316K)Full SizeSix days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as helay awake thinking of his misfortunes and of Altisidora’s pursuit ofhim, he perceived that someone was opening the door of his room with akey, and he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel wascoming to make an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger offailing in the fidelity he owed to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso. “No,”said he, firmly persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loudenough to be heard), “the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail tomake me renounce my adoration of her whom I bear stamped and graved inthe core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, ladymine, transformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph ofgolden Tagus weaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinoshold thee captive where they will; where’er thou art, thou art mine,and where’er I am, must be thine.” The very instant he had utteredthese words, the door opened. He stood up on the bed wrapped from headto foot in a yellow satin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and hisface and his moustaches tied up, his face because of the scratches, andhis moustaches to keep them from drooping and falling down, in whichtrim he looked the most extraordinary scarecrow that could beconceived. He kept his eyes fixed on the door, and just as he wasexpecting to see the love-smitten and unhappy Altisidora make herappearance, he saw coming in a most venerable duenna, in a longwhite-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from head to foot.Between the fingers of her left hand she held a short lighted candle,while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from her eyes,which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she advanced withnoiseless steps, treading very softly.Don Quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing hercostume and noting her silence, he concluded that it must be some witchor sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief,and he began crossing himself at a great rate. The spectre stilladvanced, and on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw theenergy with which Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he wasscared by seeing such a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sightof his; for the moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverletand the bandages that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, andexclaiming, “Jesus! what’s this I see?” let fall the candle in herfright, and then finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off,but stumbling on her skirts in her consternation, she measured herlength with a mighty fall.p48c.jpg (249K)Full SizeDon Quixote in his trepidation began saying, “I conjure thee, phantom,or whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst withme. If thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers cando I will do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to dogood to all the world, and to this end I have embraced the order ofknight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends todoing good even to souls in purgatory.”The unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fearguessed Don Quixote’s and in a low plaintive voice answered, “Señor DonQuixote—if so be you are indeed Don Quixote—I am no phantom or spectreor soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but Doña Rodriguez, duennaof honour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you with one of thosegrievances your worship is wont to redress.”“Tell me, Señora Doña Rodriguez,” said Don Quixote, “do you perchancecome to transact any go-between business? Because I must tell you I amnot available for anybody’s purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty ofmy lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Señora Doña Rodriguez, if youwill leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and lightyour candle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands youhave for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said, allseductive communications.”“I carry nobody’s messages, señor,” said the duenna; “little you knowme. Nay, I’m not far enough advanced in years to take to any suchchildish tricks. God be praised I have a soul in my body still, and allmy teeth and grinders in my mouth, except one or two that the colds, socommon in this Aragon country, have robbed me of. But wait a little,while I go and light my candle, and I will return immediately and laymy sorrows before you as before one who relieves those of all theworld;” and without staying for an answer she quitted the room and leftDon Quixote tranquilly meditating while he waited for her. A thousandthoughts at once suggested themselves to him on the subject of this newadventure, and it struck him as being ill done and worse advised in himto expose himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to hislady; and said he to himself, “Who knows but that the devil, being wilyand cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna, havingfailed with empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, andcountesses? Many a time have I heard it said by many a man of sensethat he will sooner offer you a flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosedone; and who knows but this privacy, this opportunity, this silence,may awaken my sleeping desires, and lead me in these my latter years tofall where I have never tripped? In cases of this sort it is better toflee than to await the battle. But I must be out of my senses to thinkand utter such nonsense; for it is impossible that a long, white-hoodedspectacled duenna could stir up or excite a wanton thought in the mostgraceless bosom in the world. Is there a duenna on earth that has fairflesh? Is there a duenna in the world that escapes being ill-tempered,wrinkled, and prudish? Avaunt, then, ye duenna crew, undelightful toall mankind. Oh, but that lady did well who, they say, had at the endof her reception room a couple of figures of duennas with spectaclesand lace-cushions, as if at work, and those statues served quite aswell to give an air of propriety to the room as if they had been realduennas.”So saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and notallow Señora Rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it SeñoraRodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer viewof Don Quixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages andnight-cap, she was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces,exclaimed, “Am I safe, sir knight? for I don’t look upon it as a signof very great virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.”“I may well ask the same, señora,” said Don Quixote; “and I do askwhether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?”“Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?”said the duenna.“Of you and against you I ask it,” said Don Quixote; “for I am notmarble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o’clock in the morning,but midnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a room moresecluded and retired than the cave could have been where thetreacherous and daring Æneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido. Butgive me your hand, señora; I require no better protection than my owncontinence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which isinspired by that venerable head-dress;” and so saying he kissed herright hand and took it in his own, she yielding it to him with equalceremoniousness. And here Cide Hamete inserts a parenthesis in which hesays that to have seen the pair marching from the door to the bed,linked hand in hand in this way, he would have given the best of thetwo tunics he had.Don Quixote finally got into bed, and Doña Rodriguez took her seat on achair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off herspectacles or putting aside the candle. Don Quixote wrapped thebedclothes round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothingbut his face visible, and as soon as they had both regained theircomposure he broke silence, saying, “Now, Señora Doña Rodriguez, youmay unbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowfulheart and afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to withchaste ears, and aided by compassionate exertions.”“I believe it,” replied the duenna; “from your worship’s gentle andwinning presence only such a Christian answer could be expected. Thefact is, then, Señor Don Quixote, that though you see me seated in thischair, here in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and in the attireof a despised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo, and ofa family with which many of the best of the province are connected byblood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, Iknow not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to thecourt of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes,my parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality,and I would have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never beensurpassed by any all my life. My parents left me in service andreturned to their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, toheaven, for they were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left anorphan with nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents thatare given to servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time,without any encouragement on my part, one of the esquires of thehousehold fell in love with me, a man somewhat advanced in years,full-bearded and personable, and above all as good a gentleman as theking himself, for he came of a mountain stock. We did not carry on ourloves with such secrecy but that they came to the knowledge of my lady,and she, not to have any fuss about it, had us married with the fullsanction of the holy mother Roman Catholic Church, of which marriage adaughter was born to put an end to my good fortune, if I had any; notthat I died in childbirth, for I passed through it safely and in dueseason, but because shortly afterwards my husband died of a certainshock he received, and had I time to tell you of it I know your worshipwould be surprised;” and here she began to weep bitterly and said,“Pardon me, Señor Don Quixote, if I am unable to control myself, forevery time I think of my unfortunate husband my eyes fill up withtears. God bless me, with what an air of dignity he used to carry mylady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet! for in those days theydid not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now, and ladies rodebehind their squires. This much at least I cannot help telling you,that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of my worthyhusband. As he was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid, whichis rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with two alguacilsbefore him, was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squire saw himhe wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn and accompanyhim. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to him in a low voice,‘What are you about, you sneak, don’t you see that I am here?’ Thealcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to him,‘Proceed, señor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my ladyDoña Casilda’—for that was my mistress’s name. Still my husband, cap inhand, persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde, and seeing this mylady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled out a big pin, or, I ratherthink, a bodkin, out of her needle-case and drove it into his back withsuch force that my husband gave a loud yell, and writhing fell to theground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran to rise her up, and thealcalde and the alguacils did the same; the Guadalajara gate was all incommotion—I mean the idlers congregated there; my mistress came back onfoot, and my husband hurried away to a barber’s shop protesting that hewas run right through the guts. The courtesy of my husband was noisedabroad to such an extent, that the boys gave him no peace in thestreet; and on this account, and because he was somewhat shortsighted,my lady dismissed him; and it was chagrin at this I am convinced beyonda doubt that brought on his death. I was left a helpless widow, with adaughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the sea-foam; at length,however, as I had the character of being an excellent needlewoman, mylady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke, offered totake me with her to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter also, andhere as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces inthe world; she sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots itlike a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums likea miser; of her neatness I say nothing, for the running water is notpurer, and her age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years fivemonths and three days, one more or less. To come to the point, the sonof a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke’s notvery far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short,how I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marryingher he made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. Andthough my lord the duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him,not once but many and many a time, and entreated him to order thefarmer to marry my daughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcelylisten to me; the reason being that as the deceiver’s father is sorich, and lends him money, and is constantly going security for hisdebts, he does not like to offend or annoy him in any way. Now, señor,I want your worship to take it upon yourself to redress this wrongeither by entreaty or by arms; for by what all the world says you cameinto it to redress grievances and right wrongs and help theunfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotected conditionof my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have said shepossesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damselsmy lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe,and the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest andgayest of them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not comewithin two leagues of her. For I would have you know, señor, all is notgold that glitters, and that same little Altisidora has moreforwardness than good looks, and more impudence than modesty; besidesbeing not very sound, for she has such a disagreeable breath that onecannot bear to be near her for a moment; and even my lady theduchess—but I’ll hold my tongue, for they say that walls have ears.”“For heaven’s sake, Doña Rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?”asked Don Quixote.“Adjured in that way,” replied the duenna, “I cannot help answering thequestion and telling the whole truth. Señor Don Quixote, have youobserved the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexionof hers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk andcarmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems tospurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went radiating healthwherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she may thank, first ofall God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one in each leg,by which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she is full,are discharged.”“Blessed Virgin!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “and is it possible that mylady the duchess has drains of that sort? I would not have believed itif the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady Doña Rodriguezsays so, it must be so. But surely such issues, and in such places, donot discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe now thatthis practice of opening issues is a very important matter for thehealth.”Don Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open witha loud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Doña Rodriguez letthe candle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as awolf’s mouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two handsseize her by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, whilesomeone else, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up herpetticoats, and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on soheartily that anyone would have felt pity for her; but although DonQuixote felt it he never stirred from his bed, but lay quiet andsilent, nay apprehensive that his turn for a drubbing might be coming.Nor was the apprehension an idle one; for leaving the duenna (who didnot dare to cry out) well basted, the silent executioners fell upon DonQuixote, and stripping him of the sheet and the coverlet, they pinchedhim so fast and so hard that he was driven to defend himself with hisfists, and all this in marvellous silence. The battle lasted nearlyhalf an hour, and then the phantoms fled; Doña Rodriguez gathered upher skirts, and bemoaning her fate went out without saying a word toDon Quixote, and he, sorely pinched, puzzled, and dejected, remainedalone, and there we will leave him, wondering who could have been theperverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state; but that shallbe told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and themethodical arrangement of the story demands it.p48e.jpg (28K)CHAPTER XLIX.OF WHAT HAPPENED SANCHO IN MAKING THE ROUND OF HIS ISLANDp49a.jpg (170K)Full SizeWe left the great governor angered and irritated by thatportrait-painting rogue of a farmer who, instructed by the majordomo,as the majordomo was by the duke, tried to practise upon him; hehowever, fool, boor, and clown as he was, held his own against themall, saying to those round him and to Doctor Pedro Recio, who as soonas the private business of the duke’s letter was disposed of hadreturned to the room, “Now I see plainly enough that judges andgovernors ought to be and must be made of brass not to feel theimportunities of the applicants that at all times and all seasonsinsist on being heard, and having their business despatched, and theirown affairs and no others attended to, come what may; and if the poorjudge does not hear them and settle the matter—either because he cannotor because that is not the time set apart for hearing them—forthwiththey abuse him, and run him down, and gnaw at his bones, and even pickholes in his pedigree. You silly, stupid applicant, don’t be in ahurry; wait for the proper time and season for doing business; don’tcome at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; for judges are only flesh andblood, and must give to Nature what she naturally demands of them; allexcept myself, for in my case I give her nothing to eat, thanks toSeñor Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me die ofhunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of lifemay God give him and all his kind—I mean the bad doctors; for the goodones deserve palms and laurels.”All who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak soelegantly, and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were thatoffice and grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men’s wits.At last Doctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let himhave supper that night though it might be in contravention of all theaphorisms of Hippocrates. With this the governor was satisfied andlooked forward to the approach of night and supper-time with greatanxiety; and though time, to his mind, stood still and made noprogress, nevertheless the hour he so longed for came, and they gavehim a beef salad with onions and some boiled calves’ feet rather fargone. At this he fell to with greater relish than if they had given himfrancolins from Milan, pheasants from Rome, veal from Sorrento,partridges from Moron, or geese from Lavajos, and turning to the doctorat supper he said to him, “Look here, señor doctor, for the futuredon’t trouble yourself about giving me dainty things or choice dishesto eat, for it will be only taking my stomach off its hinges; it isaccustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef, turnips and onions; and ifby any chance it is given these palace dishes, it receives themsqueamishly, and sometimes with loathing. What the head-carver had bestdo is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas (and the rottenerthey are the better they smell); and he can put whatever he likes intothem, so long as it is good to eat, and I’ll be obliged to him, andwill requite him some day. But let nobody play pranks on me, for eitherwe are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace and good-fellowship,for when God sends the dawn, he sends it for all. I mean to govern thisisland without giving up a right or taking a bribe; let everyone keephis eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tell them ‘thedevil’s in Cantillana,’ and if they drive me to it they’ll seesomething that will astonish them. Nay! make yourself honey and theflies eat you.”“Of a truth, señor governor,” said the carver, “your worship is in theright of it in everything you have said; and I promise you in the nameof all the inhabitants of this island that they will serve your worshipwith all zeal, affection, and good-will, for the mild kind ofgovernment you have given a sample of to begin with, leaves them noground for doing or thinking anything to your worship’s disadvantage.”“That I believe,” said Sancho; “and they would be great fools if theydid or thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feeding and myDapple’s for that is the great point and what is most to the purpose;and when the hour comes let us go the rounds, for it is my intention topurge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of all idlegood-for-nothing vagabonds; for I would have you know that lazy idlersare the same thing in a State as the drones in a hive, that eat up thehoney the industrious bees make. I mean to protect the husbandman, topreserve to the gentleman his privileges, to reward the virtuous, andabove all to respect religion and honour its ministers. What say you tothat, my friends? Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking tono purpose?”“There is so much in what your worship says, señor governor,” said themajordomo, “that I am filled with wonder when I see a man like yourworship, entirely without learning (for I believe you have none atall), say such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks,very different from what was expected of your worship’s intelligence bythose who sent us or by us who came here. Every day we see somethingnew in this world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find thetables turned upon them.”Night came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governorhad supper. They then got ready to go the rounds, and he started withthe majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler chargedwith recording his deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form afair-sized squadron. In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, asfine a sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of thetown had been traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing ofswords. They hastened to the spot, and found that the combatants werebut two, who seeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one ofthem exclaimed, “Help, in the name of God and the king! Are men to beallowed to rob in the middle of this town, and rush out and attackpeople in the very streets?”“Be calm, my good man,” said Sancho, “and tell me what the cause ofthis quarrel is; for I am the governor.”Said the other combatant, “Señor governor, I will tell you in a veryfew words. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now wonmore than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and Godknows how. I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in hisfavour, very much against what my conscience told me. He made off withhis winnings, and when I made sure he was going to give me a crown orso at least by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to givemen of quality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, andback up swindles, and prevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and leftthe house. Indignant at this I followed him, and speaking to him fairlyand civilly asked him to give me if it were only eight reals, for heknows I am an honest man and that I have neither profession norproperty, for my parents never brought me up to any or left me any; butthe rogue, who is a greater thief than Cacus and a greater sharper thanAndradilla, would not give me more than four reals; so your worship maysee how little shame and conscience he has. But by my faith if you hadnot come up I’d have made him disgorge his winnings, and he’d havelearned what the range of the steel-yard was.”“What say you to this?” asked Sancho. The other replied that all hisantagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give him morethan four reals because he very often gave him money; and that thosewho expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given themwith a cheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winnersunless they know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings tobe unfairly won; and that there could be no better proof that hehimself was an honest man than his having refused to give anything; forsharpers always pay tribute to lookers-on who know them.“That is true,” said the majordomo; “let your worship consider what isto be done with these men.”“What is to be done,” said Sancho, “is this; you, the winner, be yougood, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a hundred realsat once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners; andyou who have neither profession nor property, and hang about the islandin idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time of the dayto-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years,and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate thesentence, for I’ll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman willby my orders; not a word from either of you, or I’ll make him feel myhand.”The one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latterquitted the island, while the other went home; and then the governorsaid, “Either I am not good for much, or I’ll get rid of these gamblinghouses, for it strikes me they are very mischievous.”“This one at least,” said one of the notaries, “your worship will notbe able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what he loses everyyear is beyond all comparison more than what he makes by the cards. Onthe minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power, and itis they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices; forin the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpersdare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice of gambling hasbecome common, it is better that men should play in houses of reputethan in some tradesman’s, where they catch an unlucky fellow in thesmall hours of the morning and skin him alive.”“I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said on thatpoint,” said Sancho.And now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said,“Señor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as hesaw the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sureproof that he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it notbeen that he stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.”“What did you run for, fellow?” said Sancho.To which the young man replied, “Señor, it was to avoid answering allthe questions officers of justice put.”“What are you by trade?”“A weaver.”“And what do you weave?”“Lance heads, with your worship’s good leave.”“You’re facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag? Verygood; and where were you going just now?”“To take the air, señor.”“And where does one take the air in this island?”“Where it blows.”“Good! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart youth;but take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you a-stern,and send you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off; I’llmake him sleep there to-night without air.”“By God,” said the young man, “your worship will make me sleep in gaoljust as soon as make me king.”“Why shan’t I make thee sleep in gaol?” said Sancho. “Have I not thepower to arrest thee and release thee whenever I like?”“All the power your worship has,” said the young man, “won’t be able tomake me sleep in gaol.”“How? not able!” said Sancho; “take him away at once where he’ll seehis mistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler is willing to exerthis interested generosity on his behalf; for I’ll lay a penalty of twothousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a step from theprison.”“That’s ridiculous,” said the young man; “the fact is, all the men onearth will not make me sleep in prison.”“Tell me, you devil,” said Sancho, “have you got any angel that willdeliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order them to putupon you?”“Now, señor governor,” said the young man in a sprightly manner, “letus be reasonable and come to the point. Granted your worship may orderme to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chains put on me, andto be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler ifhe lets me out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don’t chooseto sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye,will your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if Idon’t choose?”“No, truly,” said the secretary, “and the fellow has made his point.”“So then,” said Sancho, “it would be entirely of your own choice youwould keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?”“No, señor,” said the youth, “certainly not.”“Well then, go, and God be with you,” said Sancho; “be off home tosleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don’t want to rob you of it;but for the future, let me advise you don’t joke with the authorities,because you may come across someone who will bring down the joke onyour own skull.”The young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, andshortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, andsaid, “Señor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so,but a woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man’s clothes.” Theyraised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light theydistinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age ofsixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and greensilk net, and fair as a thousand pearls. They scanned her from head tofoot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters ofwhite taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her breeches were of greenand gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she worea doublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her shoes were white andsuch as men wear; she carried no sword at her belt, but only a richlyornamented dagger, and on her fingers she had several handsome rings.In short, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and noneof those who beheld her knew her, the people of the town said theycould not imagine who she was, and those who were in on the secret ofthe jokes that were to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who weremost surprised, for this incident or discovery had not been arranged bythem; and they watched anxiously to see how the affair would end.Sancho was fascinated by the girl’s beauty, and he asked her who shewas, where she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself inthat garb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modestconfusion, “I cannot tell you, señor, before so many people what it isof such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to beknown, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whomthe power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is dueto modesty.”Hearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, “Make the people stand back,señor governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with lessembarrassment.”Sancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver,and the secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of nomore, the damsel went on to say, “I am the daughter, sirs, of PedroPerez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit ofcoming very often to my father’s house.”“That won’t do, señora,” said the majordomo; “for I know Pedro Perezvery well, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter;and besides, though you say he is your father, you add then that hecomes very often to your father’s house.”“I had already noticed that,” said Sancho.“I am confused just now, sirs,” said the damsel, “and I don’t know whatI am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de laLlana, whom you must all know.”“Ay, that will do,” said the majordomo; “for I know Diego de la Llana,and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that hehas a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobodyin all this town can speak of having seen his daughter’s face; for hekeeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun achance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremelybeautiful.”“It is true,” said the damsel, “and I am that daughter; whether reportlies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time,as you have seen me;” and with this she began to weep bitterly.On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver’s ear, andsaid to him in a low voice, “Something serious has no doubt happenedthis poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress andat such an hour, and one of her rank too.” “There can be no doubt aboutit,” returned the carver, “and moreover her tears confirm yoursuspicion.” Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreatedher to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they wouldall earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieveher.“The fact is, sirs,” said she, “that my father has kept me shut upthese ten years, for so long is it since the earth received my mother.Mass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I haveseen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars bynight; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, oreven men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez thewool-farmer; whom, because he came frequently to our house, I took itinto my head to call my father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusionand the restrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church,have been keeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed tosee the world, or at least the town where I was born, and it did notseem to me that this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens ofgood quality should have for themselves. When I heard them talking ofbull-fights taking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, Iasked my brother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me whatsort of things these were, and many more that I had never seen; heexplained them to me as well as he could, but the only effect was tokindle in me a still stronger desire to see them. At last, to cut shortthe story of my ruin, I begged and entreated my brother—O that I hadnever made such an entreaty—” And once more she gave way to a burst ofweeping.“Proceed, señora,” said the majordomo, “and finish your story of whathas happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all insuspense.”“I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,” said thedamsel; “for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.”The maiden’s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver’sheart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, andthought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew ofthe meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearlsof them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a oneas her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losingpatience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story,and told her not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, andthere still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over.She, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, “Mymisfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated mybrother to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take mesome night, when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he,overcome by my entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit andhimself in clothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for hehas not a hair on his chin, and might pass for a very beautiful younggirl), to-night, about an hour ago, more or less, we left the house,and guided by our youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit ofthe whole town, and then, as we were about to return home, we saw agreat troop of people coming, and my brother said to me, ‘Sister, thismust be the round, stir your feet and put wings to them, and follow meas fast as you can, lest they recognise us, for that would be a badbusiness for us;’ and so saying he turned about and began, I cannot sayto run but to fly; in less than six paces I fell from fright, and thenthe officer of justice came up and carried me before your worships,where I find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsicaland vicious.”“So then, señora,” said Sancho, “no other mishap has befallen you, norwas it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginningof your story?”“Nothing has happened me,” said she, “nor was it jealousy that broughtme out, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyondseeing the streets of this town.”The appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom oneof them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fullyconfirmed the truth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but arich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, andhis head was uncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which lookedlike rings of gold, so bright and curly was it. The governor, themajordomo, and the carver went aside with him, and, unheard by hissister, asked him how he came to be in that dress, and he with no lessshame and embarrassment told exactly the same story as his sister, tothe great delight of the enamoured carver; the governor, however, saidto them, “In truth, young lady and gentleman, this has been a verychildish affair, and to explain your folly and rashness there was nonecessity for all this delay and all these tears and sighs; for if youhad said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from our father’s house inthis way in order to ramble about, out of mere curiosity and with noother object, there would have been an end of the matter, and none ofthese little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.”“That is true,” said the damsel, “but you see the confusion I was inwas so great it did not let me behave as I ought.”“No harm has been done,” said Sancho; “come, we will leave you at yourfather’s house; perhaps they will not have missed you; and another timedon’t be so childish or eager to see the world; for a respectabledamsel should have a broken leg and keep at home; and the woman and thehen by gadding about are soon lost; and she who is eager to see is alsoeager to be seen; I say no more.”The youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home,and they directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off.On reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, andimmediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down andopened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party marvellingas much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeingthe world by night and without quitting the village; which, however,they set down to their youth.The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, andhe made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of herfather on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as hewas a servant of the duke’s; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes ofmarrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, andhe resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuadinghimself that no husband could be refused to a governor’s daughter. Andso the night’s round came to an end, and a couple of days later thegovernment, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, aswill be seen farther on.p49e.jpg (55K)CHAPTER L.WHEREIN IS SET FORTH WHO THE ENCHANTERS AND EXECUTIONERS WERE WHOFLOGGED THE DUENNA AND PINCHED DON QUIXOTE, AND ALSO WHAT BEFELL THEPAGE WHO CARRIED THE LETTER TO TERESA PANZA, SANCHO PANZA’S WIFEp50a.jpg (104K)Full SizeCide Hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of thisveracious history, says that when Doña Rodriguez left her own room togo to Don Quixote’s, another duenna who slept with her observed her,and as all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, shefollowed her so silently that the good Rodriguez never perceived it;and as soon as the duenna saw her enter Don Quixote’s room, not to failin a duenna’s invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off thatinstant to report to the duchess how Doña Rodriguez was closeted withDon Quixote. The duchess told the duke, and asked him to let her andAltisidora go and see what the said duenna wanted with Don Quixote. Theduke gave them leave, and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to thedoor of the room and posted themselves so close to it that they couldhear all that was said inside. But when the duchess heard how theRodriguez had made public the Aranjuez of her issues she could notrestrain herself, nor Altisidora either; and so, filled with rage andthirsting for vengeance, they burst into the room and tormented DonQuixote and flogged the duenna in the manner already described; forindignities offered to their charms and self-esteem mightily provokethe anger of women and make them eager for revenge. The duchess toldthe duke what had happened, and he was much amused by it; and she, inpursuance of her design of making merry and diverting herself with DonQuixote, despatched the page who had played the part of Dulcinea in thenegotiations for her disenchantment (which Sancho Panza in the cares ofgovernment had forgotten all about) to Teresa Panza his wife with herhusband’s letter and another from herself, and also a great string offine coral beads as a present.Now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; andeager to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for Sancho’svillage. Before he entered it he observed a number of women washing ina brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there livedthere a woman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza,squire to a knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question ayoung girl who was washing stood up and said, “Teresa Panza is mymother, and that Sancho is my father, and that knight is our master.”“Well then, miss,” said the page, “come and show me where your motheris, for I bring her a letter and a present from your father.”“That I will with all my heart, señor,” said the girl, who seemed to beabout fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washingto one of her companions, and without putting anything on her head orfeet, for she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, awayshe skipped in front of the page’s horse, saying, “Come, your worship,our house is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there,sorrowful enough at not having had any news of my father this ever solong.”“Well,” said the page, “I am bringing her such good news that she willhave reason to thank God.”And then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town,but before going into the house she called out at the door, “Come out,mother Teresa, come out, come out; here’s a gentleman with letters andother things from my good father.” At these words her mother TeresaPanza came out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (so shortwas it one would have fancied “they to her shame had cut it short”), agrey bodice of the same stuff, and a smock. She was not very old,though plainly past forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried;and seeing her daughter and the page on horseback, she exclaimed,“What’s this, child? What gentleman is this?”“A servant of my lady, Doña Teresa Panza,” replied the page; andsuiting the action to the word he flung himself off his horse, and withgreat humility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying, “Letme kiss your hand, Señora Doña Teresa, as the lawful and only wife ofSeñor Don Sancho Panza, rightful governor of the island of Barataria.”“Ah, señor, get up, do that,” said Teresa; “for I’m not a bit of acourt lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of aclodcrusher, and the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor atall.”“You are,” said the page, “the most worthy wife of a most arch-worthygovernor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letter and thispresent;” and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string ofcoral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, and said,“This letter is from his lordship the governor, and the other as wellas these coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to yourworship.”Teresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, andthe girl said, “May I die but our master Don Quixote’s at the bottom ofthis; he must have given father the government or county he so oftenpromised him.”“That is the truth,” said the page; “for it is through Señor DonQuixote that Señor Sancho is now governor of the island of Barataria,as will be seen by this letter.”“Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?” said Teresa; “for thoughI can spin I can’t read, not a scrap.”“Nor I either,” said Sanchica; “but wait a bit, and I’ll go and fetchsomeone who can read it, either the curate himself or the bachelorSamson Carrasco, and they’ll come gladly to hear any news of myfather.”“There is no need to fetch anybody,” said the page; “for though I can’tspin I can read, and I’ll read it;” and so he read it through, but asit has been already given it is not inserted here; and then he took outthe other one from the duchess, which ran as follows:Friend Teresa,—Your husband Sancho’s good qualities, of heart as wellas of head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke togive him the government of one of his many islands. I am told hegoverns like a gerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord theduke, of course, also; and I am very thankful to heaven that I have notmade a mistake in choosing him for that same government; for I wouldhave Señora Teresa know that a good governor is hard to find in thisworld and may God make me as good as Sancho’s way of governing.Herewith I send you, my dear, a string of coral beads with gold clasps;I wish they were Oriental pearls; but “he who gives thee a bone doesnot wish to see thee dead;” a time will come when we shall becomeacquainted and meet one another, but God knows the future. Commend meto your daughter Sanchica, and tell her from me to hold herself inreadiness, for I mean to make a high match for her when she leastexpects it. They tell me there are big acorns in your village; send mea couple of dozen or so, and I shall value them greatly as coming fromyour hand; and write to me at length to assure me of your health andwell-being; and if there be anything you stand in need of, it is but toopen your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and so God keep you.From this place.Your loving friend,THE DUCHESS.“Ah, what a good, plain, lowly lady!” said Teresa when she heard theletter; “that I may be buried with ladies of that sort, and not thegentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they aregentlewomen the wind must not touch them, and go to church with as muchairs as if they were queens, no less, and seem to think they aredisgraced if they look at a farmer’s wife! And see here how this goodlady, for all she’s a duchess, calls me ‘friend,’ and treats me as if Iwas her equal—and equal may I see her with the tallest church-tower inLa Mancha! And as for the acorns, señor, I’ll send her ladyship a peckand such big ones that one might come to see them as a show and awonder. And now, Sanchica, see that the gentleman is comfortable; putup his horse, and get some eggs out of the stable, and cut plenty ofbacon, and let’s give him his dinner like a prince; for the good newshe has brought, and his own bonny face deserve it all; and meanwhileI’ll run out and give the neighbours the news of our good luck, andfather curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, who are and always havebeen such friends of thy father’s.”“That I will, mother,” said Sanchica; “but mind, you must give me halfof that string; for I don’t think my lady the duchess could have beenso stupid as to send it all to you.”“It is all for thee, my child,” said Teresa; “but let me wear it roundmy neck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heart glad.”“You will be glad too,” said the page, “when you see the bundle thereis in this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth, that thegovernor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all for SeñoraSanchica.”“May he live a thousand years,” said Sanchica, “and the bearer as many,nay two thousand, if needful.”With this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and withthe string of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming theletters as if they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across thecurate and Samson Carrasco she began capering and saying, “None of uspoor now, faith! We’ve got a little government! Ay, let the finest finelady tackle me, and I’ll give her a setting down!”“What’s all this, Teresa Panza,” said they; “what madness is this, andwhat papers are those?”“The madness is only this,” said she, “that these are the letters ofduchesses and governors, and these I have on my neck are fine coralbeads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and I am agoverness.”“God help us,” said the curate, “we don’t understand you, Teresa, orknow what you are talking about.”“There, you may see it yourselves,” said Teresa, and she handed themthe letters.The curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and heregarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read,and the bachelor asked who had brought the letters. Teresa in replybade them come with her to her house and they would see the messenger,a most elegant youth, who had brought another present which was worthas much more. The curate took the coral beads from her neck andexamined them again and again, and having satisfied himself as to theirfineness he fell to wondering afresh, and said, “By the gown I wear Idon’t know what to say or think of these letters and presents; on theone hand I can see and feel the fineness of these coral beads, and onthe other I read how a duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen ofacorns.”“Square that if you can,” said Carrasco; “well, let’s go and see themessenger, and from him we’ll learn something about this mystery thathas turned up.”They did so, and Teresa returned with them. They found the page siftinga little barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of baconto be paved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsomeapparel pleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted himcourteously, and he them, Samson begged him to give them his news, aswell of Don Quixote as of Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they hadread the letters from Sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they werestill puzzled and could not make out what was meant by Sancho’sgovernment, and above all of an island, when all or most of those inthe Mediterranean belonged to his Majesty.To this the page replied, “As to Señor Sancho Panza’s being a governorthere is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that hegoverns, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a townof more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I maytell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that,not to speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she hasbeen known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of herneighbours; for I would have your worships know that the ladies ofAragon, though they are just as illustrious, are not so punctilious andhaughty as the Castilian ladies; they treat people with greaterfamiliarity.”In the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt fullof eggs, and said she to the page, “Tell me, señor, does my father weartrunk-hose since he has been governor?”“I have not noticed,” said the page; “but no doubt he wears them.”“Ah! my God!” said Sanchica, “what a sight it must be to see my fatherin tights! Isn’t it odd that ever since I was born I have had a longingto see my father in trunk-hose?”“As things go you will see that if you live,” said the page; “by God heis in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the government onlylasts him two months more.”The curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the pagespoke in a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and thehunting suit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them)did away with the impression; and they could not help laughing atSanchica’s wish, and still more when Teresa said, “Señor curate, lookabout if there’s anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me ahooped petticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; forindeed and indeed I must do honour to my husband’s government as wellas I can; nay, if I am put to it and have to, I’ll go to Court and seta coach like all the world; for she who has a governor for her husbandmay very well have one and keep one.”“And why not, mother!” said Sanchica; “would to God it were to-dayinstead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they saw meseated in the coach with my mother, ‘See that rubbish, thatgarlic-stuffed fellow’s daughter, how she goes stretched at her ease ina coach as if she was a she-pope!’ But let them tramp through the mud,and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck tobackbiters all over the world; ‘let me go warm and the people maylaugh.’ Do I say right, mother?”“To be sure you do, my child,” said Teresa; “and all this good luck,and even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt see, mydaughter, he won’t stop till he has made me a countess; for to make abeginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy good fathersay many a time (for besides being thy father he’s the father ofproverbs too), ‘When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; whenthey offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee acounty, seize it; when they say, “Here, here!” to thee with somethinggood, swallow it.’ Oh no! go to sleep, and don’t answer the strokes ofgood fortune and the lucky chances that are knocking at the door ofyour house!”“And what do I care,” added Sanchica, “whether anybody says when hesees me holding my head up, ‘The dog saw himself in hempen breeches,’and the rest of it?”Hearing this the curate said, “I do believe that all this family of thePanzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every oneof them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at alltimes and on all occasions.”“That is true,” said the page, “for Señor Governor Sancho utters themat every turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose,still they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise themhighly.”“Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho’s government istrue, señor,” said the bachelor, “and that there actually is a duchesswho sends him presents and writes to him? Because we, although we havehandled the present and read the letters, don’t believe it and suspectit to be something in the line of our fellow-townsman Don Quixote, whofancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason Iam almost ready to say that I’d like to touch and feel your worship tosee whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man offlesh and blood.”“All I know, sirs,” replied the page, “is that I am a real ambassador,and that Señor Sancho Panza is governor as a matter of fact, and thatmy lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him thissame government, and that I have heard it said Sancho Panza bearshimself very stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in allthis or not, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that’sall I know by the oath I swear, and that is by the life of my parentswhom I have still alive, and love dearly.”“It may be so,” said the bachelor; “but _dubitat Augustinus_.”“Doubt who will,” said the page; “what I have told you is the truth,and that will always rise above falsehood as oil above water; if not_operibus credite, et non verbis_. Let one of you come with me, and hewill see with his eyes what he does not believe with his ears.”“It’s for me to make that trip,” said Sanchica; “take me with you,señor, behind you on your horse; for I’ll go with all my heart to seemy father.”“Governors’ daughters,” said the page, “must not travel along the roadsalone, but accompanied by coaches and litters and a great number ofattendants.”“By God,” said Sanchica, “I can go just as well mounted on a she-ass asin a coach; what a dainty lass you must take me for!”“Hush, girl,” said Teresa; “you don’t know what you’re talking about;the gentleman is quite right, for ‘as the time so the behaviour;’ whenit was Sancho it was ‘Sancha;’ when it is governor it’s ‘señora;’ Idon’t know if I’m right.”“Señora Teresa says more than she is aware of,” said the page; “and nowgive me something to eat and let me go at once, for I mean to returnthis evening.”“Come and do penance with me,” said the curate at this; “for SeñoraTeresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest.”The page refused, but had to consent at last for his own sake; and thecurate took him home with him very gladly, in order to have anopportunity of questioning him at leisure about Don Quixote and hisdoings. The bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa;but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for shethought him somewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and acouple of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote forher two letters, one for her husband and the other for the duchess,dictated out of her own head, which are not the worst inserted in thisgreat history, as will be seen farther on.p50e.jpg (19K)CHAPTER LI.OF THE PROGRESS OF SANCHO’S GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER SUCH ENTERTAININGMATTERSp51a.jpg (188K)Full SizeDay came after the night of the governor’s round; a night which thehead-carver passed without sleeping, so were his thoughts of the faceand air and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spentwhat was left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of allSancho said and did, being as much amazed at his sayings as at hisdoings, for there was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all hiswords and deeds. The señor governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio’sdirections they made him break his fast on a little conserve and foursups of cold water, which Sancho would have readily exchanged for apiece of bread and a bunch of grapes; but seeing there was no help forit, he submitted with no little sorrow of heart and discomfort ofstomach; Pedro Recio having persuaded him that light and delicate dietenlivened the wits, and that was what was most essential for personsplaced in command and in responsible situations, where they have toemploy not only the bodily powers but those of the mind also.By means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hungerso keen that in his heart he cursed the government, and even him whohad given it to him; however, with his hunger and his conserve heundertook to deliver judgments that day, and the first thing that camebefore him was a question that was submitted to him by a stranger, inthe presence of the majordomo and the other attendants, and it was inthese words: “Señor, a large river separated two districts of one andthe same lordship—will your worship please to pay attention, for thecase is an important and a rather knotty one? Well then, on this riverthere was a bridge, and at one end of it a gallows, and a sort oftribunal, where four judges commonly sat to administer the law whichthe lord of river, bridge and the lordship had enacted, and which wasto this effect, ‘If anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to theother he shall declare on oath where he is going to and with whatobject; and if he swears truly, he shall be allowed to pass, but iffalsely, he shall be put to death for it by hanging on the gallowserected there, without any remission.’ Though the law and its severepenalty were known, many persons crossed, but in their declarations itwas easy to see at once they were telling the truth, and the judges letthem pass free. It happened, however, that one man, when they came totake his declaration, swore and said that by the oath he took he wasgoing to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else. Thejudges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, ‘If we letthis man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought todie; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on thatgallows, and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to gofree.’ It is asked of your worship, señor governor, what are the judgesto do with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; andhaving heard of your worship’s acute and exalted intellect, they havesent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion onthis very intricate and puzzling case.”To this Sancho made answer, “Indeed those gentlemen the judges thatsend you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I havemore of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case overagain, so that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able tohit the point.”The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and thenSancho said, “It seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment,and in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon thegallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the lawenacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don’thang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to behanged.”“It is as the señor governor says,” said the messenger; “and as regardsa complete comprehension of the case, there is nothing left to desireor hesitate about.”“Well then I say,” said Sancho, “that of this man they should let passthe part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and inthis way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with.”“But then, señor governor,” replied the querist, “the man will have tobe divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die;and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and itis absolutely necessary to comply with it.”“Look here, my good sir,” said Sancho; “either I’m a numskull or elsethere is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living andpassing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehoodequally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion youshould say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the argumentsfor condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, theyshould let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to dogood than to do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knewhow to sign; and what I have said in this case is not out of my ownhead, but one of the many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me thenight before I left to become governor of this island, that came intomy mind, and it was this, that when there was any doubt about thejustice of a case I should lean to mercy; and it is God’s will that Ishould recollect it now, for it fits this case as if it was made forit.”“That is true,” said the majordomo; “and I maintain that Lycurgushimself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounceda better decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning’saudience close with this, and I will see that the señor governor hasdinner entirely to his liking.”“That’s all I ask for—fair play,” said Sancho; “give me my dinner, andthen let it rain cases and questions on me, and I’ll despatch them in atwinkling.”The majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience tokill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to havedone with him that same night, playing off the last joke he wascommissioned to practise upon him.It came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in oppositionto the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were takingaway the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote forthe governor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, andif there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. Thesecretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, “Itmay well be read aloud, for what Señor Don Quixote writes to yourworship deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it isas follows.”DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA’S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THEISLAND OF BARATARIA.When I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friendSancho, I have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, forwhich I give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from thedunghill and of fools to make wise men. They tell me thou dost governas if thou wert a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so greatis the humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself. But I would havethee bear in mind, Sancho, that very often it is fitting and necessaryfor the authority of office to resist the humility of the heart; forthe seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties should besuch as they require and not measured by what his own humble tastes maylead him to prefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like astick; I do not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, orthat being a judge thou shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thoushouldst array thyself in the apparel thy office requires, and that atthe same time it be neat and handsome. To win the good-will of thepeople thou governest there are two things, among others, that thoumust do; one is to be civil to all (this, however, I told thee before),and the other to take care that food be abundant, for there is nothingthat vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high prices. Makenot many proclamations; but those thou makest take care that they begood ones, and above all that they be observed and carried out; forproclamations that are not observed are the same as if they did notexist; nay, they encourage the idea that the prince who had the wisdomand authority to make them had not the power to enforce them; and lawsthat threaten and are not enforced come to be like the log, the king ofthe frogs, that frightened them at first, but that in time theydespised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue and a stepfather tovice. Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient, but observe a meanbetween these two extremes, for in that is the aim of wisdom. Visit thegaols, the slaughter-houses, and the market-places; for the presence ofthe governor is of great importance in such places; it comforts theprisoners who are in hopes of a speedy release, it is the bugbear ofthe butchers who have then to give just weight, and it is the terror ofthe market-women for the same reason. Let it not be seen that thou art(even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe) covetous, afollower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those thathave dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they willbring their batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they havebrought thee down to the depths of perdition. Consider and reconsider,con and con over again the advices and the instructions I gave theebefore thy departure hence to thy government, and thou wilt see that inthem, if thou dost follow them, thou hast a help at hand that willlighten for thee the troubles and difficulties that beset governors atevery step. Write to thy lord and lady and show thyself grateful tothem, for ingratitude is the daughter of pride, and one of the greatestsins we know of; and he who is grateful to those who have been good tohim shows that he will be so to God also who has bestowed and stillbestows so many blessings upon him.    My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another    present to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every    moment. I have been a little indisposed through a certain    scratching I came in for, not very much to the benefit of my nose;    but it was nothing; for if there are enchanters who maltreat me,    there are also some who defend me. Let me know if the majordomo who    is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou    didst suspect; and keep me informed of everything that happens    thee, as the distance is so short; all the more as I am thinking of    giving over very shortly this idle life I am now leading, for I was    not born for it. A thing has occurred to me which I am inclined to    think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess; but    though I am sorry for it I do not care, for after all I must obey    my calling rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the    common saying, _amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas_. I quote    this Latin to thee because I conclude that since thou hast been a    governor thou wilt have learned it. Adieu; God keep thee from being    an object of pity to anyone.Thy friend,DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praisedand considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table,and calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, andwithout putting it off any longer set about answering his master DonQuixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told himwithout adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answerwas to the following effect.SANCHO PANZA’S LETTER TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.The pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time toscratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long—Godsend a remedy for it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may notbe surprised if I have not until now sent you word of how I fare, wellor ill, in this government, in which I am suffering more hunger thanwhen we two were wandering through the woods and wastes.    My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain    spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I    have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a    salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here;    he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you    see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his hands. This    doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there    are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are    diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if    leanness was not worse than fever.    In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of    vexation; for when I thought I was coming to this government to get    my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland    sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I    was a hermit; and as I don’t do it willingly I suspect that in the    end the devil will carry me off.    So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don’t    know what to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors    that come to this island, before entering it have plenty of money    either given to them or lent to them by the people of the town, and    that this is the usual custom not only here but with all who enter    upon governments.    Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man’s    clothes, and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver    has fallen in love with the girl, and has in his own mind chosen    her for a wife, so he says, and I have chosen the youth for a    son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain our intentions to the    father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentleman and    an old Christian as much as you please.    I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and    yesterday I found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved    her to have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel    of new; I confiscated the whole for the children of the    charity-school, who will know how to distinguish them well enough,    and I sentenced her not to come into the market-place for a    fortnight; they told me I did bravely. I can tell your worship it    is commonly said in this town that there are no people worse than    the market-women, for they are all barefaced, unconscionable, and    impudent, and I can well believe it from what I have seen of them    in other towns.    I am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa    Panza and sent her the present your worship speaks of; and I will    strive to show myself grateful when the time comes; kiss her hands    for me, and tell her I say she has not thrown it into a sack with a    hole in it, as she will see in the end. I should not like your    worship to have any difference with my lord and lady; for if you    fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm; and as you give    me advice to be grateful it will not do for your worship not to be    so yourself to those who have shown you such kindness, and by whom    you have been treated so hospitably in their castle.    That about the scratching I don’t understand; but I suppose it must    be one of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your    worship; when we meet I shall know all about it. I wish I could    send your worship something; but I don’t know what to send, unless    it be some very curious clyster pipes, to work with bladders, that    they make in this island; but if the office remains with me I’ll    find out something to send, one way or another. If my wife Teresa    Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send me the letter, for I    have a very great desire to hear how my house and wife and children    are going on. And so, may God deliver your worship from evil-minded    enchanters, and bring me well and peacefully out of this    government, which I doubt, for I expect to take leave of it and my    life together, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treats me.Your worship’s servantSANCHO PANZA THE GOVERNOR.The secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier;and those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting theirheads together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government.Sancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating tothe good government of what he fancied the island; and he ordained thatthere were to be no provision hucksters in the State, and that menmight import wine into it from any place they pleased, provided theydeclared the quarter it came from, so that a price might be put upon itaccording to its quality, reputation, and the estimation it was heldin; and he that watered his wine, or changed the name, was to forfeithis life for it. He reduced the prices of all manner of shoes, boots,and stockings, but of shoes in particular, as they seemed to him to runextravagantly high. He established a fixed rate for servants’ wages,which were becoming recklessly exorbitant. He laid extremely heavypenalties upon those who sang lewd or loose songs either by day ornight. He decreed that no blind man should sing of any miracle inverse, unless he could produce authentic evidence that it was true, forit was his opinion that most of those the blind men sing are trumpedup, to the detriment of the true ones. He established and created analguacil of the poor, not to harass them, but to examine them and seewhether they really were so; for many a sturdy thief or drunkard goesabout under cover of a make-believe crippled limb or a sham sore. In aword, he made so many good rules that to this day they are preservedthere, and are called _The constitutions of the great governor SanchoPanza_.p51e.jpg (32K)CHAPTER LII.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND DISTRESSED OR AFFLICTEDDUENNA, OTHERWISE CALLED DOÑA RODRIGUEZp52a.jpg (131K)Full SizeCide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his scratchesfelt that the life he was leading in the castle was entirelyinconsistent with the order of chivalry he professed, so he determinedto ask the duke and duchess to permit him to take his departure forSaragossa, as the time of the festival was now drawing near, and hehoped to win there the suit of armour which is the prize at festivalsof the sort. But one day at table with the duke and duchess, just as hewas about to carry his resolution into effect and ask for theirpermission, lo and behold suddenly there came in through the door ofthe great hall two women, as they afterwards proved to be, draped inmourning from head to foot, one of whom approaching Don Quixote flungherself at full length at his feet, pressing her lips to them, anduttering moans so sad, so deep, and so doleful that she put all whoheard and saw her into a state of perplexity; and though the duke andduchess supposed it must be some joke their servants were playing offupon Don Quixote, still the earnest way the woman sighed and moaned andwept puzzled them and made them feel uncertain, until Don Quixote,touched with compassion, raised her up and made her unveil herself andremove the mantle from her tearful face. She complied and disclosedwhat no one could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed thecountenance of Doña Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the otherfemale in mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of bythe rich farmer’s son. All who knew her were filled with astonishment,and the duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her asimpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazypranks. Doña Rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistresssaid to them, “Will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speakto this gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so inorder to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness ofan evil-minded clown has involved me?”The duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she mightspeak with Señor Don Quixote as much as she liked.She then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him said,“Some days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of theinjustice and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloveddaughter, the unhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me totake her part and right the wrong that has been done her; but now ithas come to my hearing that you are about to depart from this castle inquest of such fair adventures as God may vouchsafe to you; therefore,before you take the road, I would that you challenge this frowardrustic, and compel him to marry my daughter in fulfillment of thepromise he gave her to become her husband before he seduced her; for toexpect that my lord the duke will do me justice is to ask pears fromthe elm tree, for the reason I stated privately to your worship; and somay our Lord grant you good health and forsake us not.”To these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, “Worthyduenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, forI take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom itwould have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers’promises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowlyperformed; and so, with my lord the duke’s leave, I will at once go inquest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge himand slay him, if so be he refuses to keep his promised word; for thechief object of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise theproud; I mean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.”“There is no necessity,” said the duke, “for your worship to take thetrouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy duenna complains,nor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leave to challengehim; for I admit him duly challenged, and will take care that he isinformed of the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it inperson to this castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fairfield, observing all the conditions which are usually and properlyobserved in such trials, and observing too justice to both sides, asall princes who offer a free field to combatants within the limits oftheir lordships are bound to do.”“Then with that assurance and your highness’s good leave,” said DonQuixote, “I hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood,and come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth of thewrong-doer, making myself equal with him and enabling him to enter intocombat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him, though absent, on theplea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, whowas a maiden and now by his misdeed is none; and say that he shallfulfill the promise he gave her to become her lawful husband, or elsestake his life upon the question.”And then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of thehall, and the duke picked it up, saying, as he had said before, that heaccepted the challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six daysthence as the time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and forarms the customary ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour,with all the other accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms ofany sort, and examined and passed by the judges of the field. “Butfirst of all,” he said, “it is requisite that this worthy duenna andunworthy damsel should place their claim for justice in the hands ofDon Quixote; for otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the saidchallenge be brought to a lawful issue.”“I do so place it,” replied the duenna.“And I too,” added her daughter, all in tears and covered with shameand confusion.This declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in hisown mind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew,and the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to betreated as servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to herhouse to demand justice; so they gave them a room to themselves andwaited on them as they would on strangers, to the consternation of theother women-servants, who did not know where the folly and imprudenceof Doña Rodriguez and her unlucky daughter would stop.And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner toa satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the lettersand presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, enteredthe hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him,being anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they askedhim the page said in reply that he could not give it before so manypeople or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased tolet it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amusethemselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he placedthem in the duchess’s hand. One bore by way of address, _Letter for mylady the Duchess So-and-so, of I don’t know where; and the other To myhusband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom Godprosper longer than me_. The duchess’s bread would not bake, as thesaying is, until she had read her letter; and having looked over itherself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and allpresent to hear, she read out as follows.TERESA PANZA’S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS.The letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, forindeed I found it very welcome. The string of coral beads is very fine,and my husband’s hunting suit does not fall short of it. All thisvillage is very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor ofmy good man Sancho; though nobody will believe it, particularly thecurate, and Master Nicholas the barber, and the bachelor SamsonCarrasco; but I don’t care for that, for so long as it is true, as itis, they may all say what they like; though, to tell the truth, if thecoral beads and the suit had not come I would not have believed iteither; for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull, andexcept for governing a flock of goats, they cannot fancy what sort ofgovernment he can be fit for. God grant it, and direct him according ashe sees his children stand in need of it. I am resolved with yourworship’s leave, lady of my soul, to make the most of this fair day,and go to Court to stretch myself at ease in a coach, and make allthose I have envying me already burst their eyes out; so I beg yourexcellence to order my husband to send me a small trifle of money, andto let it be something to speak of, because one’s expenses are heavy atthe Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meat thirty maravedis a pound,which is beyond everything; and if he does not want me to go let himtell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to be off; and myfriends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a figureand a brave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far more byme than I by him, for of course plenty of people will ask, “Who arethose ladies in that coach?” and some servant of mine will answer, “Thewife and daughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island ofBarataria;” and in this way Sancho will become known, and I’ll bethought well of, and “to Rome for everything.” I am as vexed as vexedcan be that they have gathered no acorns this year in our village; forall that I send your highness about half a peck that I went to the woodto gather and pick out one by one myself, and I could find no biggerones; I wish they were as big as ostrich eggs.    Let not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take    care to answer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there    may be in this place, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your    highness in his keeping and not to forget me.    Sancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship’s hands.    She who would rather see your ladyship than write to you,Your servant,TERESA PANZA.All were greatly amused by Teresa Panza’s letter, but particularly theduke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote’s opinion whetherthey might open the letter that had come for the governor, which shesuspected must be very good. Don Quixote said that to gratify them hewould open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.TERESA PANZA’S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA.I got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as aCatholic Christian that I was within two fingers’ breadth of going madI was so happy. I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thouwert a governor I thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; andthou knowest they say sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and asfor Sanchica thy daughter, she leaked from sheer happiness. I hadbefore me the suit thou didst send me, and the coral beads my lady theduchess sent me round my neck, and the letters in my hands, and therewas the bearer of them standing by, and in spite of all this I verilybelieved and thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream; forwho could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor ofislands? Thou knowest, my friend, what my mother used to say, that onemust live long to see much; I say it because I expect to see more if Ilive longer; for I don’t expect to stop until I see thee a farmer oftaxes or a collector of revenue, which are offices where, though thedevil carries off those who make a bad use of them, still they make andhandle money. My lady the duchess will tell thee the desire I have togo to the Court; consider the matter and let me know thy pleasure; Iwill try to do honour to thee by going in a coach.    Neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the    sacristan, can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the    whole thing is a delusion or an enchantment affair, like everything    belonging to thy master Don Quixote; and Samson says he must go in    search of thee and drive the government out of thy head and the    madness out of Don Quixote’s skull; I only laugh, and look at my    string of beads, and plan out the dress I am going to make for our    daughter out of thy suit. I sent some acorns to my lady the    duchess; I wish they had been gold. Send me some strings of pearls    if they are in fashion in that island. Here is the news of the    village; La Berrueca has married her daughter to a good-for-nothing    painter, who came here to paint anything that might turn up. The    council gave him an order to paint his Majesty’s arms over the door    of the town-hall; he asked two ducats, which they paid him in    advance; he worked for eight days, and at the end of them had    nothing painted, and then said he had no turn for painting such    trifling things; he returned the money, and for all that has    married on the pretence of being a good workman; to be sure he has    now laid aside his paint-brush and taken a spade in hand, and goes    to the field like a gentleman. Pedro Lobo’s son has received the    first orders and tonsure, with the intention of becoming a priest.    Minguilla, Mingo Silvato’s granddaughter, found it out, and has    gone to law with him on the score of having given her promise of    marriage. Evil tongues say she is with child by him, but he denies    it stoutly. There are no olives this year, and there is not a drop    of vinegar to be had in the whole village. A company of soldiers    passed through here; when they left they took away with them three    of the girls of the village; I will not tell thee who they are;    perhaps they will come back, and they will be sure to find those    who will take them for wives with all their blemishes, good or bad.    Sanchica is making bonelace; she earns eight maravedis a day clear,    which she puts into a moneybox as a help towards house furnishing;    but now that she is a governor’s daughter thou wilt give her a    portion without her working for it. The fountain in the plaza has    run dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish they    all lit there. I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind    about my going to the Court; and so, God keep thee longer than me,    or as long, for I would not leave thee in this world without me.Thy wife,TERESA PANZA.The letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; andthen, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived,bringing the one Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was readout, and it raised some doubts as to the governor’s simplicity. Theduchess withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in Sancho’svillage, which he narrated at full length without leaving a singlecircumstance unmentioned. He gave her the acorns, and also a cheesewhich Teresa had given him as being particularly good and superior tothose of Tronchon. The duchess received it with greatest delight, inwhich we will leave her, to describe the end of the government of thegreat Sancho Panza, flower and mirror of all governors of islands.p52e.jpg (13K)CHAPTER LIII.OF THE TROUBLOUS END AND TERMINATION SANCHO PANZA’S GOVERNMENT CAME TOp53a.jpg (109K)Full SizeTo fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain forever in the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in iteverything seems to go in a circle, I mean round and round. The springsucceeds the summer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, theautumn the winter, and the winter the spring, and so time rolls withnever-ceasing wheel. Man’s life alone, swifter than time, speeds onwardto its end without any hope of renewal, save it be in that other lifewhich is endless and boundless. Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometanphilosopher; for there are many that by the light of nature alone,without the light of faith, have a comprehension of the fleeting natureand instability of this present life and the endless duration of thateternal life we hope for; but our author is here speaking of therapidity with which Sancho’s government came to an end, melted away,disappeared, vanished as it were in smoke and shadow. For as he lay inbed on the night of the seventh day of his government, sated, not withbread and wine, but with delivering judgments and giving opinions andmaking laws and proclamations, just as sleep, in spite of hunger, wasbeginning to close his eyelids, he heard such a noise of bell-ringingand shouting that one would have fancied the whole island was going tothe bottom. He sat up in bed and remained listening intently to try ifhe could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar; notonly, however, was he unable to discover what it was, but as countlessdrums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of the bells and shouts,he was more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear and terror; andgetting up he put on a pair of slippers because of the dampness of thefloor, and without throwing a dressing gown or anything of the kindover him he rushed out of the door of his room, just in time to seeapproaching along a corridor a band of more than twenty persons withlighted torches and naked swords in their hands, all shouting out, “Toarms, to arms, señor governor, to arms! The enemy is in the island incountless numbers, and we are lost unless your skill and valour come toour support.”Keeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sanchostood dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as theyapproached one of them called out to him, “Arm at once, your lordship,if you would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.”“What have I to do with arming?” said Sancho. “What do I know aboutarms or supports? Better leave all that to my master Don Quixote, whowill settle it and make all safe in a trice; for I, sinner that I am,God help me, don’t understand these scuffles.”“Ah, señor governor,” said another, “what slackness of mettle this is!Arm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and defensive; come outto the plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls upon you by right,for you are our governor.”“Arm me then, in God’s name,” said Sancho, and they at once producedtwo large shields they had come provided with, and placed them upon himover his shirt, without letting him put on anything else, one shield infront and the other behind, and passing his arms through openings theyhad made, they bound him tight with ropes, so that there he was walledand boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his knees orstir a single step. In his hand they placed a lance, on which he leantto keep himself from falling, and as soon as they had him thus fixedthey bade him march forward and lead them on and give them all courage;for with him for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sureto bring their business to a successful issue.p53b.jpg (332K)Full Size“How am I to march, unlucky being that I am?” said Sancho, “when Ican’t stir my knee-caps, for these boards I have bound so tight to mybody won’t let me. What you must do is carry me in your arms, and layme across or set me upright in some postern, and I’ll hold it eitherwith this lance or with my body.”“On, señor governor!” cried another, “it is fear more than the boardsthat keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, for there is notime to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shouts growlouder, and the danger is pressing.”Urged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made anattempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that hefancied he had broken himself all to pieces. There he lay like atortoise enclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between twokneading-troughs, or a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang ofjokers feel any compassion for him when they saw him down; so far fromthat, extinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and torenew the calls to arms with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, andslashing at him over the shield with their swords in such a way that,if he had not gathered himself together and made himself small anddrawn in his head between the shields, it would have fared badly withthe poor governor, as, squeezed into that narrow compass, he lay,sweating and sweating again, and commending himself with all his heartto God to deliver him from his present peril. Some stumbled over him,others fell upon him, and one there was who took up a position on topof him for some time, and from thence as if from a watchtower issuedorders to the troops, shouting out, “Here, our side! Here the enemy isthickest! Hold the breach there! Shut that gate! Barricade thoseladders! Here with your stink-pots of pitch and resin, and kettles ofboiling oil! Block the streets with feather beds!” In short, in hisardour he mentioned every little thing, and every implement and engineof war by means of which an assault upon a city is warded off, whilethe bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and suffered all, was sayingto himself, “O if it would only please the Lord to let the island belost at once, and I could see myself either dead or out of thistorture!” Heaven heard his prayer, and when he least expected it heheard voices exclaiming, “Victory, victory! The enemy retreats beaten!Come, señor governor, get up, and come and enjoy the victory, anddivide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the might of thatinvincible arm.”“Lift me up,” said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice. Theyhelped him to rise, and as soon as he was on his feet said, “The enemyI have beaten you may nail to my forehead; I don’t want to divide thespoils of the foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if I have one,to give me a sup of wine, for I’m parched with thirst, and wipe me dry,for I’m turning to water.”They rubbed him down, fetched him wine and unbound the shields, and heseated himself upon his bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue hefainted away. Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorrythey had pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his fainting away hadcaused them was relieved by his returning to himself. He asked whato’clock it was; they told him it was just daybreak. He said no more,and in silence began to dress himself, while all watched him, waitingto see what the haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant.p53c.jpg (389K)Full SizeHe got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he was sorelybruised and could not go fast, he proceeded to the stable, followed byall who were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him and gave hima loving kiss on the forehead, and said to him, not without tears inhis eyes, “Come along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils andsorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me exceptmending your harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were myhours, my days, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted thetowers of ambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles,and four thousand anxieties have entered into my soul;” and all thewhile he was speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack-saddle onthe ass, without a word from anyone. Then having Dapple saddled, he,with great pain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himselfto the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio thedoctor and several others who stood by, he said, “Make way, gentlemen,and let me go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life,and raise myself up from this present death. I was not born to be agovernor or protect islands or cities from the enemies that choose toattack them. Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are morein my way than defending provinces or kingdoms. Saint Peter is verywell at Rome; I mean each of us is best following the trade he was bornto. A reaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor’s sceptre; I’drather have my fill of gazpacho than be subject to the misery of ameddling doctor who kills me with hunger, and I’d rather lie in summerunder the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a doublesheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets anddress in sables under the restraint of a government. God be with yourworships, and tell my lord the duke that ‘naked I was born, naked Ifind myself, I neither lose nor gain;’ I mean that without a farthing Icame into this government, and without a farthing I go out of it, verydifferent from the way governors commonly leave other islands. Standaside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every oneof my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been tramplingover me to-night.”“That is unnecessary, señor governor,” said Doctor Recio, “for I willgive your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soonmake you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet I promiseyour worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of whateveryou like.”“You spoke late,” said Sancho. “I’d as soon turn Turk as stay anylonger. Those jokes won’t pass a second time. By God I’d as soon remainin this government, or take another, even if it was offered me betweentwo plates, as fly to heaven without wings. I am of the breed of thePanzas, and they are every one of them obstinate, and if they once say‘odds,’ odds it must be, no matter if it is evens, in spite of all theworld. Here in this stable I leave the ant’s wings that lifted me upinto the air for the swifts and other birds to eat me, and let’s taketo level ground and our feet once more; and if they’re not shod inpinked shoes of cordovan, they won’t want for rough sandals of hemp;‘every ewe to her like,’ ‘and let no one stretch his leg beyond thelength of the sheet;’ and now let me pass, for it’s growing late withme.”To this the majordomo said, “Señor governor, we would let your worshipgo with all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you, foryour wit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it iswell known that every governor, before he leaves the place where he hasbeen governing, is bound first of all to render an account. Let yourworship do so for the ten days you have held the government, and thenyou may go and the peace of God go with you.”“No one can demand it of me,” said Sancho, “but he whom my lord theduke shall appoint; I am going to meet him, and to him I will render anexact one; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is no otherproof needed to show that I have governed like an angel.”“By God the great Sancho is right,” said Doctor Recio, “and we shouldlet him go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him.”They all agreed to this, and allowed him to go, first offering to bearhim company and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort orfor the journey. Sancho said he did not want anything more than alittle barley for Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf forhimself; for the distance being so short there was no occasion for anybetter or bulkier provant. They all embraced him, and he with tearsembraced all of them, and left them filled with admiration not only athis remarks but at his firm and sensible resolution.p53e.jpg (56K)CHAPTER LIV.WHICH DEALS WITH MATTERS RELATING TO THIS HISTORY AND NO OTHERp54a.jpg (109K)Full SizeThe duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, forthe reason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceededwith; and as the young man was in Flanders, whither he had fled toescape having Doña Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged tosubstitute for him a Gascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of allcarefully instructing him in all he had to do. Two days later the duketold Don Quixote that in four days from that time his opponent wouldpresent himself on the field of battle armed as a knight, and wouldmaintain that the damsel lied by half a beard, nay a whole beard, ifshe affirmed that he had given her a promise of marriage. Don Quixotewas greatly pleased at the news, and promised himself to do wonders inthe lists, and reckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity shouldhave offered for letting his noble hosts see what the might of hisstrong arm was capable of; and so in high spirits and satisfaction heawaited the expiration of the four days, which measured by hisimpatience seemed spinning themselves out into four hundred ages. Letus leave them to pass as we do other things, and go and bear Sanchocompany, as mounted on Dapple, half glad, half sad, he paced along onhis road to join his master, in whose society he was happier than inbeing governor of all the islands in the world. Well then, it sohappened that before he had gone a great way from the island of hisgovernment (and whether it was island, city, town, or village that hegoverned he never troubled himself to inquire) he saw coming along theroad he was travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of thatsort that beg for alms singing; who as they drew near arrangedthemselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together began tosing in their own language something that Sancho could not understand,with the exception of one word which sounded plainly “alms,” from whichhe gathered that it was alms they asked for in their song; and being,as Cide Hamete says, remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforjasthe half loaf and half cheese he had been provided with, and gave themto them, explaining to them by signs that he had nothing else to givethem. They received them very gladly, but exclaimed, “Geld! Geld!”“I don’t understand what you want of me, good people,” said Sancho.On this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it toSancho, by which he comprehended they were asking for money, andputting his thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gavethem to understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him, andurging Dapple forward he broke through them. But as he was passing, oneof them who had been examining him very closely rushed towards him, andflinging his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish,“God bless me! What’s this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my armsmy dear friend, my good neighbour Sancho Panza? But there’s no doubtabout it, for I’m not asleep, nor am I drunk just now.”Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and findhimself embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadilywithout speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrimperceiving his perplexity cried, “What! and is it possible, SanchoPanza, that thou dost not know thy neighbour Ricote, the Moriscoshopkeeper of thy village?”Sancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall hisfeatures, and at last recognised him perfectly, and without getting offthe ass threw his arms round his neck saying, “Who the devil could haveknown thee, Ricote, in this mummer’s dress thou art in? Tell me, whohas frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain, whereif they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough withthee?”“If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,” said the pilgrim, “I am safe; forin this dress no one will recognise me; but let us turn aside out ofthe road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat andrest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very goodfellows; I’ll have time enough to tell thee then all that has happenedme since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty’s edict thatthreatened such severities against the unfortunate people of my nation,as thou hast heard.”Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims theywithdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out ofthe road. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim’s cloaksand remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking youngfellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. Theycarried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at leastwith things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from twoleagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making atablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives,walnut, scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they werepast gnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black daintycalled, they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a greatthirst-wakener. Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, andwithout any seasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. Butwhat made the best show in the field of the banquet was half a dozenbotas of wine, for each of them produced his own from his alforjas;even the good Ricote, who from a Morisco had transformed himself into aGerman or Dutchman, took out his, which in size might have vied withthe five others. They then began to eat with very great relish and veryleisurely, making the most of each morsel—very small ones ofeverything—they took up on the point of the knife; and then all at thesame moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouths placed intheir mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they were takingaim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, waggingtheir heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasurethey were enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles intotheir own stomachs.Sancho beheld all, “and nothing gave him pain;” so far from that,acting on the proverb he knew so well, “when thou art at Rome do asthou seest,” he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest ofthem, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botas bear beinguplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier andmore sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that hadbeen kept up so far begin to flag.Every now and then someone of them would grasp Sancho’s right hand inhis own saying, “Español y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compaño;” and Sanchowould answer, “Bon compaño, jur a Di!” and then go off into a fit oflaughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the moment ofanything that had befallen him in his government; for cares have verylittle sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, thewine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come overthem, and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth.Ricote and Sancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more anddrunk less, and Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves atthe foot of a beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; andwithout once falling into his own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke asfollows in pure Castilian:“Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how theproclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against thoseof my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did,insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain wasout, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and uponmy children. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one whoknows that at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken fromhim, and looks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, Isay, to leave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go toseek out some place to remove them to comfortably and not in thehurried way in which the others took their departure; for I saw veryplainly, and so did all the older men among us, that the proclamationswere not mere threats, as some said, but positive enactments whichwould be enforced at the appointed time; and what made me believe thiswas what I knew of the base and extravagant designs which our peopleharboured, designs of such a nature that I think it was a divineinspiration that moved his Majesty to carry out a resolution sospirited; not that we were all guilty, for some there were true andsteadfast Christians; but they were so few that they could make no headagainst those who were not; and it was not prudent to cherish a viperin the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short it was with justcause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, a mild andlenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible that couldbe inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for after allwe were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do we findthe reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all theparts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, andwelcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew notour good fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almostall of us have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myselfknow the language, and there are many who do, come back to it and leavetheir wives and children forsaken yonder, so great is their love forit; and now I know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet isthe love of one’s country.“I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though theygave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. Icrossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me wemight live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay anyattention to trifling points; everyone lives as he likes, for in mostparts they enjoy liberty of conscience. I took a house in a town nearAugsburg, and then joined these pilgrims, who are in the habit ofcoming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines there,which they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain source ofgain. They travel nearly all over it, and there is no town out of whichthey do not go full up of meat and drink, as the saying is, and with areal, at least, in money, and they come off at the end of their travelswith more than a hundred crowns saved, which, changed into gold, theysmuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their staves or inthe patches of their pilgrim’s cloaks or by some device of their own,and carry to their own country in spite of the guards at the posts andpasses where they are searched. Now my purpose is, Sancho, to carryaway the treasure that I left buried, which, as it is outside the town,I shall be able to do without risk, and to write, or cross over fromValencia, to my daughter and wife, who I know are at Algiers, and findsome means of bringing them to some French port and thence to Germany,there to await what it may be God’s will to do with us; for, after all,Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter and Francisca Ricota mywife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not so much so, still Iam more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always my prayer to Godthat he will open the eyes of my understanding and show me how I am toserve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand is why my wifeand daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to France, wherethey could live as Christians.”To this Sancho replied, “Remember, Ricote, that may not have been opento them, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife’s brother took them, and being atrue Moor he went where he could go most easily; and another thing Ican tell thee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for whatthou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-lawand thy wife a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which theybrought to be passed.”“That may be,” said Ricote; “but I know they did not touch my hoard,for I did not tell them where it was, for fear of accidents; and so, ifthou wilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to take it away and concealit, I will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relievethy necessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they are many.”“I would do it,” said Sancho; “but I am not at all covetous, for I gaveup an office this morning in which, if I was, I might have made thewalls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six monthswere over; and so for this reason, and because I feel I would be guiltyof treason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not go with theeif instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give me fourhundred here in hand.”“And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?” asked Ricote.“I have given up being governor of an island,” said Sancho, “and such aone, faith, as you won’t find the like of easily.”“And where is this island?” said Ricote.“Where?” said Sancho; “two leagues from here, and it is called theisland of Barataria.”“Nonsense! Sancho,” said Ricote; “islands are away out in the sea;there are no islands on the mainland.”“What? No islands!” said Sancho; “I tell thee, friend Ricote, I left itthis morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like asagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me adangerous office, a governor’s.”“And what hast thou gained by the government?” asked Ricote.“I have gained,” said Sancho, “the knowledge that I am no good forgoverning, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that areto be got by these governments are got at the cost of one’s rest andsleep, ay and even one’s food; for in islands the governors must eatlittle, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.”“I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but it seems to me allnonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islands to govern? Isthere any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art forgovernors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses, andconsider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to takeaway treasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, itis so large), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I toldthee.”“And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,” said Sancho;“let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed, and go thyway in God’s name and let me go mine; for I know that well-gotten gainmay be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its ownerlikewise.”“I will not press thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but tell me, wert thouin our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law left it?”“I was so,” said Sancho; “and I can tell thee thy daughter left itlooking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her, andeverybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. She wept asshe went, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those whocame out to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God andOur Lady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made meweep myself, though I’m not much given to tears commonly; and, faith,many a one would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off onthe road; but the fear of going against the king’s command kept themback. The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, therich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love withher; and since she left he has not been seen in our village again, andwe all suspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so farnothing has been heard of it.”“I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for mydaughter,” said Ricote; “but as I felt sure of my Ricota’s virtue itgave me no uneasiness to know that he loved her; for thou must haveheard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage inamours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thoughtmore of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herselfabout the attentions of this heir.”“God grant it,” said Sancho, “for it would be a bad business for bothof them; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for I want to reachwhere my master Don Quixote is to-night.”“God be with thee, brother Sancho,” said Ricote; “my comrades arebeginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continue ourjourney;” and then they both embraced, and Sancho mounted Dapple, andRicote leant upon his staff, and so they parted.p54e.jpg (40K)CHAPTER LV.OF WHAT BEFELL SANCHO ON THE ROAD, AND OTHER THINGS THAT CANNOT BESURPASSEDp55a.jpg (126K)Full SizeThe length of time he delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho fromreaching the duke’s castle that day, though he was within half a leagueof it when night, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This,however, as it was summer time, did not give him much uneasiness, andhe turned aside out of the road intending to wait for morning; but hisill luck and hard fate so willed it that as he was searching about fora place to make himself as comfortable as possible, he and Dapple fellinto a deep dark hole that lay among some very old buildings. As hefell he commended himself with all his heart to God, fancying he wasnot going to stop until he reached the depths of the bottomless pit;but it did not turn out so, for at little more than thrice a man’sheight Dapple touched bottom, and he found himself sitting on himwithout having received any hurt or damage whatever. He felt himselfall over and held his breath to try whether he was quite sound or had ahole made in him anywhere, and finding himself all right and whole andin perfect health he was profuse in his thanks to God our Lord for themercy that had been shown him, for he made sure he had been broken intoa thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides of the pit with hishands to see if it were possible to get out of it without help, but hefound they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, at which hewas greatly distressed, especially when he heard how pathetically anddolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no wonder he complained,nor was it from ill-temper, for in truth he was not in a very goodcase. “Alas,” said Sancho, “what unexpected accidents happen at everystep to those who live in this miserable world! Who would have saidthat one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of anisland, giving orders to his servants and his vassals, would seehimself to-day buried in a pit without a soul to help him, or servantor vassal to come to his relief? Here must we perish with hunger, myass and myself, if indeed we don’t die first, he of his bruises andinjuries, and I of grief and sorrow. At any rate I’ll not be as luckyas my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he went down into the caveof that enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of himthan if he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for atable laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fair and pleasantvisions, but here I’ll see, I imagine, toads and adders. Unlucky wretchthat I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to! They’lltake up my bones out of this, when it is heaven’s will that I’m found,picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple’s with them, andby that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such ashave heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his assfrom Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fateshould not let us die in our own country and among our own people,where if there was no help for our misfortune, at any rate there wouldbe someone to grieve for it and to close our eyes as we passed away! Ocomrade and friend, how ill have I repaid thy faithful services!Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thou canst, to deliver usout of this miserable strait we are both in; and I promise to put acrown of laurel on thy head, and make thee look like a poet laureate,and give thee double feeds.”p55b.jpg (273K)Full SizeIn this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him,but answered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish thepoor beast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bittermoanings and lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceivedthat it was wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help,and he fell to bemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find outif there was anyone within hearing; but all his shouting was onlycrying in the wilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in theneighbourhood to hear him, and then at last he gave himself up fordead. Dapple was lying on his back, and Sancho helped him to his feet,which he was scarcely able to keep; and then taking a piece of breadout of his alforjas which had shared their fortunes in the fall, hegave it to the ass, to whom it was not unwelcome, saying to him as ifhe understood him, “With bread all sorrows are less.”And now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough toadmit a person if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass.Sancho made for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide andspacious on the inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlightthat penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly. Heobserved too that it opened and widened out into another spaciouscavity; seeing which he made his way back to where the ass was, andwith a stone began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a shorttime he had made room for the beast to pass easily, and thisaccomplished, taking him by the halter, he proceeded to traverse thecavern to see if there was any outlet at the other end. He advanced,sometimes in the dark, sometimes without light, but never without fear;“God Almighty help me!” said he to himself; “this that is amisadventure to me would make a good adventure for my master DonQuixote. He would have been sure to take these depths and dungeons forflowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, and would have counted uponissuing out of this darkness and imprisonment into some bloomingmeadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless, expect atevery step another pit deeper than the first to open under my feet andswallow me up for good; ‘welcome evil, if thou comest alone.’”In this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to havetravelled rather more than half a league, when at last he perceived adim light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side,showing that this road, which appeared to him the road to the otherworld, led to some opening.Here Cide Hamete leaves him, and returns to Don Quixote, who in highspirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for thebattle he was to fight with him who had robbed Doña Rodriguez’sdaughter of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction forthe wrong and injury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then,that having sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himselfin what he would have to do in the encounter he expected to findhimself engaged in the next day, as he was putting Rocinante throughhis paces or pressing him to the charge, he brought his feet so closeto a pit that but for reining him in tightly it would have beenimpossible for him to avoid falling into it. He pulled him up, however,without a fall, and coming a little closer examined the hole withoutdismounting; but as he was looking at it he heard loud cries proceedingfrom it, and by listening attentively was able to make out that he whouttered them was saying, “Ho, above there! is there any Christian thathears me, or any charitable gentleman that will take pity on a sinnerburied alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned governor?”It struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard,whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice asmuch as he could, he cried out, “Who is below there? Who is thatcomplaining?”“Who should be here, or who should complain,” was the answer, “but theforlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of theisland of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knight Don Quixoteof La Mancha?”When Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and hisperturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to hismind that Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment downthere; and carried away by this idea he exclaimed, “I conjure thee byeverything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell mewho thou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thouwouldst have me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid andsuccour to those that need it in this world, it will also extend toaiding and succouring the distressed of the other, who cannot helpthemselves.”“In that case,” answered the voice, “your worship who speaks to me mustbe my master Don Quixote of La Mancha; nay, from the tone of the voiceit is plain it can be nobody else.”“Don Quixote I am,” replied Don Quixote, “he whose profession it is toaid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; whereforetell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, ifthou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, since the devils havenot carried thee off, and thou art by God’s mercy in purgatory, ourholy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory means sufficientto release thee from the pains thou art in; and I for my part willplead with her to that end, so far as my substance will go; withoutfurther delay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thou art.”“By all that’s good,” was the answer, “and by the birth of whomsoeveryour worship chooses, I swear, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, that Iam your squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died all my life;but that, having given up my government for reasons that would requiremore time to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I am now,and Dapple is witness and won’t let me lie, for more by token he ishere with me.”Nor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sanchosaid, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the wholecave rang again.“Famous testimony!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “I know that bray as well asif I was its mother, and thy voice too, my Sancho. Wait while I go tothe duke’s castle, which is close by, and I will bring someone to takethee out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee.”“Go, your worship,” said Sancho, “and come back quick for God’s sake;for I cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and I’m dying offear.”Don Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke andduchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonishedat it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from theconfirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence therefrom time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted thegovernment without their receiving any intimation of his coming. To bebrief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint ofmany hands and much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out ofthe darkness into the light of day. A student who saw him remarked,“That’s the way all bad governors should come out of their governments,as this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger,pale, and I suppose without a farthing.”Sancho overheard him and said, “It is eight or ten days, brothergrowler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gaveme, and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for anhour; doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I anyopportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case,as it is, I don’t deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but‘man proposes and God disposes;’ and God knows what is best, and whatsuits each one best; and ‘as the occasion, so the behaviour;’ and ‘letnobody say “I won’t drink of this water;”’ and ‘where one thinks thereare flitches, there are no pegs;’ God knows my meaning and that’senough; I say no more, though I could.”“Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,” said DonQuixote, “or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscienceand let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers’ tonguesis like trying to put gates to the open plain. If a governor comes outof his government rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comesout poor, that he has been a noodle and a blockhead.”“They’ll be pretty sure this time,” said Sancho, “to set me down for afool rather than a thief.”Thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, theyreached the castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchessstood waiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the dukeuntil he had first put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he hadpassed a very bad night in his last quarters; then he went upstairs tosee his lord and lady, and kneeling before them he said, “Because itwas your highnesses’ pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, Iwent to govern your island of Barataria, which ‘I entered naked, andnaked I find myself; I neither lose nor gain.’ Whether I have governedwell or ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. Ihave answered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying ofhunger, for Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governordoctor, would have it so. Enemies attacked us by night and put us in agreat quandary, but the people of the island say they came off safe andvictorious by the might of my arm; and may God give them as much healthas there’s truth in what they say. In short, during that time I haveweighed the cares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and bymy reckoning I find my shoulders can’t bear them, nor are they a loadfor my loins or arrows for my quiver; and so, before the governmentthrew me over I preferred to throw the government over; and yesterdaymorning I left the island as I found it, with the same streets, houses,and roofs it had when I entered it. I asked no loan of anybody, nor didI try to fill my pocket; and though I meant to make some useful laws, Imade hardly any, as I was afraid they would not be kept; for in thatcase it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them. Iquitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fellinto a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light ofthe sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heavensent me my master Don Quixote, I’d have stayed there till the end ofthe world. So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is yourgovernor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he has held thegovernment has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything tobe governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and thatpoint being settled, kissing your worships’ feet, and imitating thegame of the boys when they say, ‘leap thou, and give me one,’ I take aleap out of the government and pass into the service of my master DonQuixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear andtrembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I’mfull, it’s all alike to me whether it’s with carrots or withpartridges.”Here Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having beenthe whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and whenhe found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. Theduke embraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given upthe government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided withsome other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. Theduchess also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken goodcare of, as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worsebruised.p55e.jpg (18K)CHAPTER LVI.br/> OF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOKPLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THE LACQUEY TOSILOS INDEFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF DOÑA RODRIGUEZp56a.jpg (158K)Full SizeThe duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had beenplayed upon Sancho Panza in giving him the government; especially astheir majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute accountof almost every word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during thetime; and to wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack uponthe island and Sancho’s fright and departure, with which they were nota little amused. After this the history goes on to say that the dayfixed for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after havingrepeatedly instructed his lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixoteso as to vanquish him without killing or wounding him, gave orders tohave the heads removed from the lances, telling Don Quixote thatChristian charity, on which he plumed himself, could not suffer thebattle to be fought with so much risk and danger to life; and that hemust be content with the offer of a battlefield on his territory(though that was against the decree of the holy Council, whichprohibits all challenges of the sort) and not push such an arduousventure to its extreme limits. Don Quixote bade his excellence arrangeall matters connected with the affair as he pleased, as on his part hewould obey him in everything. The dread day, then, having arrived, andthe duke having ordered a spacious stand to be erected facing the courtof the castle for the judges of the field and the appellant duennas,mother and daughter, vast crowds flocked from all the villages andhamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel spectacle of the battle;nobody, dead or alive, in those parts having ever seen or heard of sucha one.The first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of theceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that therewas nothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumbleor fall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped inmantles covering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying noslight emotion as Don Quixote appeared in the lists. Shortlyafterwards, accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerfulsteed that threatened to crush the whole place, the great lacqueyTosilos made his appearance on one side of the courtyard with his visordown and stiffly cased in a suit of stout shining armour. The horse wasa manifest Frieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half ahundred of wool hanging to each of his fetlocks. The gallant combatantcame well primed by his master the duke as to how he was to bearhimself against the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; being warned thathe must on no account slay him, but strive to shirk the first encounterso as to avoid the risk of killing him, as he was sure to do if he methim full tilt. He crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to wherethe duennas were placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for ahusband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had alreadypresented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosiloshe addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that DonQuixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right. They said theydid, and that whatever he should do in that behalf they declaredrightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke and duchess hadtaken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which wasfilled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see thisperilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat werethat if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry thedaughter of Doña Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponentwas released from the promise that was claimed against him and from allobligations to give satisfaction. The master of the ceremoniesapportioned the sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot wherehe was to stand. The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled theair, the earth trembled under foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd werefull of anxiety, some hoping for a happy issue, some apprehensive of anuntoward ending to the affair, and lastly, Don Quixote, commendinghimself with all his heart to God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea delToboso, stood waiting for them to give the necessary signal for theonset. Our lacquey, however, was thinking of something very different;he only thought of what I am now going to mention.It seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as themost beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the littleblind boy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind tolet slip the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding itto the list of his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen,he drove a dart two yards long into the poor lacquey’s left side andpierced his heart through and through; which he was able to do quite athis ease, for Love is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes,without anyone calling him to account for what he does. Well then, whenthey gave the signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy,musing upon the beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of hisliberty, and so he paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet,unlike Don Quixote, who was off the instant he heard it, and, at thehighest speed Rocinante was capable of, set out to meet his enemy, hisgood squire Sancho shouting lustily as he saw him start, “God guidethee, cream and flower of knights-errant! God give thee the victory,for thou hast the right on thy side!” But though Tosilos saw DonQuixote coming at him he never stirred a step from the spot where hewas posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to the marshal of thefield, to whom when he came up to see what he wanted he said, “Señor,is not this battle to decide whether I marry or do not marry thatlady?” “Just so,” was the answer. “Well then,” said the lacquey, “Ifeel qualms of conscience, and I should lay a heavy burden upon it if Iwere to proceed any further with the combat; I therefore declare that Iyield myself vanquished, and that I am willing to marry the lady atonce.”The marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words ofTosilos; and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangementof the affair he knew not what to say in reply. Don Quixote pulled upin mid career when he saw that his enemy was not coming on to theattack. The duke could not make out the reason why the battle did notgo on; but the marshal of the field hastened to him to let him knowwhat Tosilos said, and he was amazed and extremely angry at it. In themeantime Tosilos advanced to where Doña Rodriguez sat and said in aloud voice, “Señora, I am willing to marry your daughter, and I have nowish to obtain by strife and fighting what I can obtain in peace andwithout any risk to my life.”The valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, “As that is the case I amreleased and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, andas ‘God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.’”The duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going upto Tosilos he said to him, “Is it true, sir knight, that you yieldyourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wishto marry this damsel?”“It is, señor,” replied Tosilos.“And he does well,” said Sancho, “for what thou hast to give to themouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.”Tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged themto come to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him,and he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. Theyremoved it in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed topublic gaze. At this sight Doña Rodriguez and her daughter raised amighty outcry, exclaiming, “This is a trick! This is a trick! They haveput Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, upon us in place of the realhusband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not tosay roguery!”“Do not distress yourselves, ladies,” said Don Quixote; “for this is notrickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at thebottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who,jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned yourhusband’s features into those of this person, who you say is a lacqueyof the duke’s; take my advice, and notwithstanding the malice of myenemies marry him, for beyond a doubt he is the one you wish for ahusband.”When the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit oflaughter, and he said, “The things that happen to Señor Don Quixote areso extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is notone; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriagefor, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we areuncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that timehe may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchantersentertain against Señor Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially asit is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions andtransformations.”“Oh, señor,” said Sancho, “those scoundrels are well used to changingwhatever concerns my master from one thing into another. A knight thathe overcame some time back, called the Knight of the Mirrors, theyturned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our town and agreat friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have turnedinto a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have tolive and die a lacquey all the days of his life.”Here the Rodriguez’s daughter exclaimed, “Let him be who he may, thisman that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for the same, for Ihad rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress ofa gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind.”To be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilosbeing shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. Allhailed Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed anddisappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiouslywaiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boysare disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does notcome out, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him. Thepeople dispersed, the duke and Don Quixote returned to the castle, theylocked up Tosilos, Doña Rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectlycontented when they saw that any way the affair must end in marriage,and Tosilos wanted nothing else.p56e.jpg (46K)CHAPTER LVII.WHICH TREATS OF HOW DON QUIXOTE TOOK LEAVE OF THE DUKE, AND OF WHATFOLLOWED WITH THE WITTY AND IMPUDENT ALTISIDORA, ONE OF THE DUCHESS’SDAMSELSp57a.jpg (119K)Full SizeDon Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he wasleading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorelymissed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid thecountless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as aknight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict accountto heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked theduke and duchess to grant him permission to take his departure. Theygave it, showing at the same time that they were very sorry he wasleaving them.p57b.jpg (370K)Full SizeThe duchess gave his wife’s letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tearsover them, saying, “Who would have thought that such grand hopes as thenews of my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza’s breast would endin my going back now to the vagabond adventures of my master DonQuixote of La Mancha? Still I’m glad to see my Teresa behaved as sheought in sending the acorns, for if she had not sent them I’d have beensorry, and she’d have shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfort to methat they can’t call that present a bribe; for I had got the governmentalready when she sent them, and it’s but reasonable that those who havehad a good turn done them should show their gratitude, if it’s onlywith a trifle. After all I went into the government naked, and I comeout of it naked; so I can say with a safe conscience—and that’s nosmall matter—‘naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose norgain.’”Thus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as DonQuixote, who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess,coming out made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in thecourtyard of the castle. The whole household of the castle werewatching him from the corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, cameout to see him. Sancho was mounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas,valise, and proven supremely happy because the duke’s majordomo, thesame that had acted the part of the Trifaldi, had given him a littlepurse with two hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses ofthe road, but of this Don Quixote knew nothing as yet. While all were,as has been said, observing him, suddenly from among the duennas andhandmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora lifted up her voice andsaid in pathetic tones:Give ear, cruel knight;Draw rein; where’s the needOf spurring the flanksOf that ill-broken steed?From what art thou flying?No dragon I am,Not even a sheep,But a tender young lamb.Thou hast jilted a maidenAs fair to beholdAs nymph of DianaOr Venus of old.Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!In thy claws, ruthless robber,Thou bearest awayThe heart of a meekLoving maid for thy prey,Three kerchiefs thou stealest,And garters a pair,From legs than the whitestOf marble more fair;And the sighs that pursue theeWould burn to the groundTwo thousand Troy Towns,If so many were found.Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!May no bowels of mercyTo Sancho be granted,And thy DulcineaBe left still enchanted,May thy falsehood to meFind its punishment in her,For in my land the justOften pays for the sinner.May thy grandest adventuresDiscomfitures prove,May thy joys be all dreams,And forgotten thy love.Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!May thy name be abhorredFor thy conduct to ladies,From London to England,From Seville to Cadiz;May thy cards be unlucky,Thy hands contain ne’er aKing, seven, or aceWhen thou playest primera;When thy corns are cutMay it be to the quick;When thy grinders are drawnMay the roots of them stick.Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!All the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the abovestrain Don Quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word inreply to her he turned round to Sancho and said, “Sancho my friend, Iconjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say,hast thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters thislove-sick maid speaks of?”To this Sancho made answer, “The three kerchiefs I have; but thegarters, as much as ‘over the hills of Úbeda.’”The duchess was amazed at Altisidora’s assurance; she knew that she wasbold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to makefree in this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, herastonishment was all the greater. The duke had a mind to keep up thesport, so he said, “It does not seem to me well done in you, sirknight, that after having received the hospitality that has beenoffered you in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry offeven three kerchiefs, not to say my handmaid’s garters. It shows a badheart and does not tally with your reputation. Restore her garters, orelse I defy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascallyenchanters changing or altering my features as they changed his whoencountered you into those of my lacquey, Tosilos.”“God forbid,” said Don Quixote, “that I should draw my sword againstyour illustrious person from which I have received such great favours.The kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them; as to thegarters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has he;and if your handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend uponit she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor doI mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in hiskeeping. This damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, forwhich I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either ofher or of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion ofme, and once more to give me leave to pursue my journey.”“And may God so prosper it, Señor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “thatwe may always hear good news of your exploits; God speed you; for thelonger you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels whobehold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise her thatshe will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her words.”“One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,” saidAltisidora, “and that is that I beg your pardon about the theft of thegarters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I havefallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his assbeing all the while mounted on it.”“Didn’t I say so?” said Sancho. “I’m a likely one to hide thefts! Whyif I wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me inmy government.”Don Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and allthe bystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him onDapple, he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa.p57e.jpg (71K)CHAPTER LVIII.WHICH TELLS HOW ADVENTURES CAME CROWDING ON DON QUIXOTE IN SUCH NUMBERSTHAT THEY GAVE ONE ANOTHER NO BREATHING-TIMEp58a.jpg (105K)Full SizeWhen Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved fromthe attentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spiritsto take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho, hesaid, “Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heavenhas bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or thesea conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life mayand should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is thegreatest evil that can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho,because thou hast seen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed inthis castle we are leaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets andsnow-cooled beverages I felt as though I were undergoing the straits ofhunger, because I did not enjoy them with the same freedom as if theyhad been mine own; for the sense of being under an obligation to returnbenefits and favours received is a restraint that checks theindependence of the spirit. Happy he, to whom heaven has given a pieceof bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but heavenitself!”“For all your worship says,” said Sancho, “it is not becoming thatthere should be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns thatthe duke’s majordomo has given me in a little purse which I carry nextmy heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet any chancecalls; for we shan’t always find castles where they’ll entertain us;now and then we may light upon roadside inns where they’ll cudgel us.”In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuingtheir journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half aleague, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretchedupon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner.They had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing someobjects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged atintervals. Don Quixote approached the diners, and, saluting themcourteously first, he asked them what it was those cloths covered.“Señor,” answered one of the party, “under these cloths are some imagescarved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in ourvillage; we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and onour shoulders that they may not be broken.”“With your good leave,” said Don Quixote, “I should like to see them;for images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones.”“I should think they were!” said the other; “let the money they costspeak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one of them thatdoes not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship mayjudge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;” andgetting up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image, whichproved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent writhingat his feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all thatfierceness that is usually depicted. The whole group was one blaze ofgold, as the saying is. On seeing it Don Quixote said, “That knight wasone of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he wascalled Don Saint George, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Letus see this next one.”The man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on hishorse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote sawit he said, “This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, butI believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,Sancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him halfof it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would havegiven him the whole of it, so charitable was he.”“It was not that, most likely,” said Sancho, “but that he held with theproverb that says, ‘For giving and keeping there’s need of brains.’”Don Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth,underneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spainsseated on horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moorsand treading heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed,“Ay, this is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one iscalled Don Saint James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints andknights the world ever had or heaven has now.”They then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paulfalling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given inrepresentations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered insuch lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking andPaul answering, “This,” he said, “was in his time the greatest enemythat the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatest champion it willever have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, anuntiring labourer in the Lord’s vineyard, a teacher of the Gentiles,whose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master was JesusChrist himself.”There were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them upagain, and said to those who had brought them, “I take it as a happyomen, brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knightswere of the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms;only there is this difference between them and me, that they weresaints, and fought with divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fightwith human ones. They won heaven by force of arms, for heaven sufferethviolence; and I, so far, know not what I have won by dint of mysufferings; but if my Dulcinea del Toboso were to be released fromhers, perhaps with mended fortunes and a mind restored to itself Imight direct my steps in a better path than I am following at present.”“May God hear and sin be deaf,” said Sancho to this.The men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the wordsof Don Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what hemeant by them. They finished their dinner, took their images on theirbacks, and bidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.Sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master’s knowledge, asmuch as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there wasno story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers’ ends andfixed in his memory, and he said to him, “In truth, master mine, ifthis that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, ithas been one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us inthe whole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelabouredand undismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten theearth with our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be Godthat he has let me see such a thing with my own eyes!”“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but remember all timesare not alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things thevulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any naturalreason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happyaccidents merely. One of these believers in omens will get up of amorning, leave his house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessedSaint Francis, and, as if he had met a griffin, he will turn about andgo home. With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloomis spilt over his heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning ofcoming misfortunes by means of such trivial things as these. The wiseman and the Christian should not trifle with what it may please heavento do. Scipio on coming to Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; hissoldiers took it as a bad omen; but he, clasping the soil with hisarms, exclaimed, ‘Thou canst not escape me, Africa, for I hold theetight between my arms.’ Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been tome a most happy occurrence.”“I can well believe it,” said Sancho; “but I wish your worship wouldtell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are about togive battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say‘Santiago and close Spain!’ Is Spain, then, open, so that it is needfulto close it; or what is the meaning of this form?”“Thou art very simple, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “God, look you, gavethat great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patron saint andprotector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had withthe Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as theirdefender in all their battles; and in these he has been many a timeseen beating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughteringthe Hagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could givethee many examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.”Sancho changed the subject, and said to his master, “I marvel, señor,at the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess’s handmaid; he whom theycall Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is alittle blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speakingsightless, if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it andpierces it through and through with his arrows. I have heard it saidtoo that the arrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points bymaidenly modesty and reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems theyare sharpened rather than blunted.”“Bear in mind, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that love is influenced byno consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of thesame nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings andthe humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession ofa heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it;and so without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited inmy mind embarrassment rather than commiseration.”“Notable cruelty!” exclaimed Sancho; “unheard-of ingratitude! I canonly say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers wouldhave subdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What a heart ofmarble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can’timagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could haveconquered and captivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what boldbearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which ofthese things by itself, or what all together, could have made her fallin love with you? For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look atyour worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of yourhead, and I see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love;moreover I have heard say that beauty is the first and main thing thatexcites love, and as your worship has none at all, I don’t know whatthe poor creature fell in love with.”“Recollect, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “there are two sorts ofbeauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the minddisplays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourableconduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities arepossible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort ofbeauty and not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt tospring up suddenly and violently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enoughthat I am not beautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous;and it is enough for an honest man not to be a monster to be an objectof love, if only he possesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.”While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through awood that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expectinganything of the kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets ofgreen cord stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceivewhat it could be, he said to Sancho, “Sancho, it strikes me this affairof these nets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable.May I die if the enchanters that persecute me are not trying toentangle me in them and delay my journey, by way of revenge for myobduracy towards Altisidora. Well then let me tell them that if thesenets, instead of being green cord, were made of the hardest diamonds,or stronger than that wherewith the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshedVenus and Mars, I would break them as easily as if they were made ofrushes or cotton threads.” But just as he was about to press forwardand break through all, suddenly from among some trees two shepherdessesof surpassing beauty presented themselves to his sight—or at leastdamsels dressed like shepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayaswere of fine brocade; that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingalesof gold embroidered tabby. Their hair, that in its golden brightnessvied with the beams of the sun itself, fell loose upon their shouldersand was crowned with garlands twined with green laurel and redeverlasting; and their years to all appearance were not under fifteennor above eighteen.p58b.jpg (452K)Full SizeSuch was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinatedDon Quixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and heldall four in a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, wasthe first to speak and said to Don Quixote, “Hold, sir knight, and donot break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm,but only for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they havebeen put up, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In avillage some two leagues from this, where there are many people ofquality and rich gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friendsand relations to come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours,friends and kinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of thepleasantest in the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoralArcadia among ourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdessesand the youths as shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by thefamous poet Garcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in itsown Portuguese tongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday wasthe first day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say arecalled field-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an amplebrook that fertilises all these meadows; last night we spread thesenets in the trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled bythe noise we make may fly into them. If you please to be our guest,señor, you will be welcomed heartily and courteously, for here just nowneither care nor sorrow shall enter.”She held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, “Of atruth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathingin the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck thanI at the sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment,and thank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serveyou, you may command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for myprofession is none other than to show myself grateful, and ready toserve persons of all conditions, but especially persons of quality suchas your appearance indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as theyprobably do, but a small space, these nets took up the whole surface ofthe globe, I would seek out new worlds through which to pass, so as notto break them; and that ye may give some degree of credence to thisexaggerated language of mine, know that it is no less than Don Quixoteof La Mancha that makes this declaration to you, if indeed it be thatsuch a name has reached your ears.”“Ah! friend of my soul,” instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess,“what great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou this gentleman wehave before us? Well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant andthe most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world,unless a history of his achievements that has been printed and I haveread is telling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that thisgood fellow who is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whosedrolleries none can equal.”“That’s true,” said Sancho; “I am that same droll and squire you speakof, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, the samethat’s in the history and that they talk about.”“Oh, my friend,” said the other, “let us entreat him to stay; for itwill give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too have heardjust what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleriesof the other; and what is more, of him they say that he is the mostconstant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady isone Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty isawarded.”“And justly awarded,” said Don Quixote, “unless, indeed, yourunequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselves thetrouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of myprofession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.”At this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood abrother of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume,and as richly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that theircompanion was the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the otherSancho his squire, of whom he knew already from having read theirhistory. The gay shepherd offered him his services and begged that hewould accompany him to their tents, and Don Quixote had to give way andcomply. And now the game was started, and the nets were filled with avariety of birds that deceived by the colour fell into the danger theywere flying from. Upwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired asshepherds and shepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at onceinformed who Don Quixote and his squire were, whereat they were not alittle delighted, as they knew of him already through his history. Theyrepaired to the tents, where they found tables laid out, and choicely,plentifully, and neatly furnished. They treated Don Quixote as a personof distinction, giving him the place of honour, and all observed him,and were full of astonishment at the spectacle. At last the cloth beingremoved, Don Quixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said:“One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is—some will saypride—but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell isfull of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I haveendeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason;and if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me byother deeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be notenough I make them known publicly; for he who declares and makes knownthe good deeds done to him would repay them by others if it were in hispower, and for the most part those who receive are the inferiors ofthose who give. Thus, God is superior to all because he is the supremegiver, and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance ofbeing a full return for the gifts of God; but gratitude in some degreemakes up for this deficiency and shortcoming. I therefore, grateful forthe favour that has been extended to me here, and unable to make areturn in the same measure, restricted as I am by the narrow limits ofmy power, offer what I can and what I have to offer in my own way; andso I declare that for two full days I will maintain in the middle ofthis highway leading to Saragossa, that these ladies disguised asshepherdesses, who are here present, are the fairest and most courteousmaidens in the world, excepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso,sole mistress of my thoughts, be it said without offence to those whohear me, ladies and gentlemen.”On hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention,cried out in a loud voice, “Is it possible there is anyone in the worldwho will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman?Say, gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wiseor learned, who could say what my master has said; or is thereknight-errant, whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, thatcould offer what my master has offered now?”Don Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing withanger said to him, “Is it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in thewhole world who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match,and I know not what trimmings of impertinence and roguery? Who askedthee to meddle in my affairs, or to inquire whether I am a wise man ora blockhead? Hold thy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante ifhe be unsaddled; and let us go to put my offer into execution; for withthe right that I have on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished allwho shall venture to question it;” and in a great rage, and showing hisanger plainly, he rose from his seat, leaving the company lost inwonder, and making them feel doubtful whether they ought to regard himas a madman or a rational being. In the end, though they sought todissuade him from involving himself in such a challenge, assuring himthey admitted his gratitude as fully established, and needed no freshproofs to be convinced of his valiant spirit, as those related in thehistory of his exploits were sufficient, still Don Quixote persisted inhis resolve; and mounted on Rocinante, bracing his buckler on his armand grasping his lance, he posted himself in the middle of a high roadthat was not far from the green meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple,together with all the members of the pastoral gathering, eager to seewhat would be the upshot of his vainglorious and extraordinaryproposal.Don Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in themiddle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: “Hoye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or onhorseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the nexttwo days! Know that Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is postedhere to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in thenymphs that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth,putting aside the lady of my heart, Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, lethim who is of the opposite opinion come on, for here I await him.”Twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by anyadventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better tobetter, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on theroad a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in theirhands, all riding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner hadthose who were with Don Quixote seen them than they turned about andwithdrew to some distance from the road, for they knew that if theystayed some harm might come to them; but Don Quixote with intrepidheart stood his ground, and Sancho Panza shielded himself withRocinante’s hind-quarters. The troop of lancers came up, and one ofthem who was in advance began shouting to Don Quixote, “Get out of theway, you son of the devil, or these bulls will knock you to pieces!”“Rabble!” returned Don Quixote, “I care nothing for bulls, be they thefiercest Jarama breeds on its banks. Confess at once, scoundrels, thatwhat I have declared is true; else ye have to deal with me in combat.”The herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of theway even if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tamebullocks, together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who weretaking them to be penned up in a village where they were to be run thenext day, passed over Don Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante andDapple, hurling them all to the earth and rolling them over on theground. Sancho was left crushed, Don Quixote scared, Dapple belabouredand Rocinante in no very sound condition.p58c.jpg (399K)Full SizeThey all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste,stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,shouting out, “Hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaitsyou, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, ‘For aflying enemy make a bridge of silver.’” The retreating party in theirhaste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any morethan last year’s clouds. Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, andmore enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until Sancho,Rocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him master and manmounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the mockor imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, theycontinued their journey.p58e.jpg (68K)Full SizeCHAPTER LIX.WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS ANADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTEp59a.jpg (126K)Full SizeA clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relievedDon Quixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolitebehaviour of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dappleand Rocinante loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair,master and man, seated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder ofhis alforjas and took out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixoterinsed his mouth and bathed his face, by which cooling process hisflagging energies were revived. Out of pure vexation he remainedwithout eating, and out of pure politeness Sancho did not venture totouch a morsel of what was before him, but waited for his master to actas taster. Seeing, however, that, absorbed in thought, he wasforgetting to carry the bread to his mouth, he said never a word, andtrampling every sort of good breeding under foot, began to stow away inhis paunch the bread and cheese that came to his hand.p59b.jpg (370K)Full Size“Eat, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote; “support life, which is ofmore consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the painof my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born, Sancho, tolive dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what Isay, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous inbehaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, whenI looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by myvaliant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, andcrushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought bluntsmy teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of allappetite for food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die ofhunger, the cruelest death of all deaths.”“So then,” said Sancho, munching hard all the time, “your worship doesnot agree with the proverb that says, ‘Let Martha die, but let her diewith a full belly.’ I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so farfrom that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leatherwith his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants. I’ll stretchout my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it;and let me tell you, señor, there’s no greater folly than to think ofdying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eatinglie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will seethat when you awake you’ll feel something better.”Don Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho’sreasoning was more like a philosopher’s than a blockhead’s, and saidhe, “Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell thee myease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not sogreat; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping inaccordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, togive thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante’s reins, onaccount of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for thedisenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor ladyshould be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.”“There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Sancho; “let usboth go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what will happen.Let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold bloodis a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an ill-nourishedand worse-fed body. Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, and when she isleast expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and‘until death it’s all life;’ I mean that I have still life in me, andthe desire to make good what I have promised.”Don Quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, andthen they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friendsand comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feedunrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow wasfurnished. They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumedtheir journey, pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight,apparently a league off. I say an inn, because Don Quixote called itso, contrary to his usual practice of calling all inns castles. Theyreached it, and asked the landlord if they could put up there. He saidyes, with as much comfort and as good fare as they could find inSaragossa. They dismounted, and Sancho stowed away his larder in a roomof which the landlord gave him the key. He took the beasts to thestable, fed them, and came back to see what orders Don Quixote, who wasseated on a bench at the door, had for him, giving special thanks toheaven that this inn had not been taken for a castle by his master.Supper-time came, and they repaired to their room, and Sancho asked thelandlord what he had to give them for supper. To this the landlordreplied that his mouth should be the measure; he had only to ask whathe would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air and thefowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.“There’s no need of all that,” said Sancho; “if they’ll roast us acouple of chickens we’ll be satisfied, for my master is delicate andeats little, and I’m not over and above gluttonous.”The landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.“Well then,” said Sancho, “let señor landlord tell them to roast apullet, so that it is a tender one.”“Pullet! My father!” said the landlord; “indeed and in truth it’s onlyyesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; but saving pullets askwhat you will.”“In that case,” said Sancho, “you will not be without veal or kid.”“Just now,” said the landlord, “there’s none in the house, for it’s allfinished; but next week there will be enough and to spare.”“Much good that does us,” said Sancho; “I’ll lay a bet that all theseshort-comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon and eggs.”“By God,” said the landlord, “my guest’s wits must be precious dull; Itell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wants me to have eggs!Talk of other dainties, if you please, and don’t ask for hens again.”“Body o’ me!” said Sancho, “let’s settle the matter; say at once whatyou have got, and let us have no more words about it.”“In truth and earnest, señor guest,” said the landlord, “all I have isa couple of cow-heels like calves’ feet, or a couple of calves’ feetlike cowheels; they are boiled with chick-peas, onions, and bacon, andat this moment they are crying ‘Come eat me, come eat me.”“I mark them for mine on the spot,” said Sancho; “let nobody touchthem; I’ll pay better for them than anyone else, for I could not wishfor anything more to my taste; and I don’t care a pin whether they arefeet or heels.”“Nobody shall touch them,” said the landlord; “for the other guests Ihave, being persons of high quality, bring their own cook and catererand larder with them.”“If you come to people of quality,” said Sancho, “there’s nobody moreso than my master; but the calling he follows does not allow of lardersor store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow, andfill ourselves with acorns or medlars.”Here ended Sancho’s conversation with the landlord, Sancho not caringto carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked himwhat calling or what profession it was his master was of.Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room,the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himselfdown to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which wasnext to Don Quixote’s, with nothing but a thin partition to separateit, he overheard these words, “As you live, Señor Don Jeronimo, whilethey are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the SecondPart of ‘Don Quixote of La Mancha.’”The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet andlistened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heardthe Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, “Why would youhave us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible foranyone who has read the First Part of the history of ‘Don Quixote of LaMancha’ to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?”“For all that,” said he who was addressed as Don Juan, “we shall dowell to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something goodin it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixoteas now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.”On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted uphis voice and said, “Whoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of LaMancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teachhim with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; forneither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor canforgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, andhis profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.”“Who is this that answers us?” said they in the next room.“Who should it be,” said Sancho, “but Don Quixote of La Mancha himself,who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledgesdon’t trouble a good payer.”Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such theyseemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his armsround Don Quixote’s neck, said to him, “Your appearance cannot leaveany question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify yourappearance; unquestionably, señor, you are the real Don Quixote of LaMancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and indefiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naughtyour achievements, as the author of this book which I here present toyou has done;” and with this he put a book which his companion carriedinto the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying beganto run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, “In thelittle I have seen I have discovered three things in this author thatdeserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in thepreface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes hewrites without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him asignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the mostimportant part of the history, for here he says that my squire SanchoPanza’s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing ofthe sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an importantpoint as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on everyother point in the history.”“A nice sort of historian, indeed!” exclaimed Sancho at this; “he mustknow a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, MariGutierrez; take the book again, señor, and see if I am in it and if hehas changed my name.”“From your talk, friend,” said Don Jeronimo, “no doubt you are SanchoPanza, Señor Don Quixote’s squire.”“Yes, I am,” said Sancho; “and I’m proud of it.”“Faith, then,” said the gentleman, “this new author does not handle youwith the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you outa heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a verydifferent being from the Sancho described in the First Part of yourmaster’s history.”“God forgive him,” said Sancho; “he might have left me in my cornerwithout troubling his head about me; ‘let him who knows how ring thebells; ‘Saint Peter is very well in Rome.’”The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and havesupper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that innfit for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded totheir request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew.and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at thehead of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was noless fond of cow-heel and calves’ feet than Sancho was.While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the ladyDulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, orwas she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving hermodesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion ofSeñor Don Quixote?To this he replied, “Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion morefirmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, andher beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;” and then heproceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantmentof Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos,together with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for herdisenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho.Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived fromhearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; andif they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by theelegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regardedhim as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them amaundering blockhead, and they could not make up their mindswhereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him.Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the Xcondition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came insaid, “May I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships havegot has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton(according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call medrunkard too.”“But he does,” said Don Jeronimo; “I cannot remember, however, in whatway, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, asI can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.”“Believe me,” said Sancho, “the Sancho and the Don Quixote of thishistory must be different persons from those that appear in the oneCide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant,wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nordrunkard.”“I believe it,” said Don Juan; “and were it possible, an order shouldbe issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anythingrelating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just asAlexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portraitsave Apelles.”p60b.jpg (336K)Full Size“Let him who will paint me,” said Don Quixote; “but let him not abuseme; for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.”“None can be offered to Señor Don Quixote,” said Don Juan, “that hehimself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with theshield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.”A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of thissort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the bookto see what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, sayingthat he treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if byany chance it should come to its author’s ears that he had it in hishand, he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he hadread it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keepthemselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy.They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, toSaragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in thatcity every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described howDon Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting atthe ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor incostume, though rich in sillinesses.“For that very reason,” said Don Quixote, “I will not set foot inSaragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie ofthis new history writer, and people will see that I am not the DonQuixote he speaks of.”“You will do quite right,” said Don Jeronimo; “and there are otherjousts at Barcelona in which Señor Don Quixote may display hisprowess.”“That is what I mean to do,” said Don Quixote; “and as it is now time,I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to placeand retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.”“And me too,” said Sancho; “maybe I’ll be good for something.”With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retiredto their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see themedley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they feltthoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese authordescribed, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rosebetimes, and bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition ofthe other room. Sancho paid the landlord magnificently, and recommendedhim either to say less about the providing of his inn or to keep itbetter provided.p59e.jpg (48K)CHAPTER LX.OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO BARCELONAp60a.jpg (129K)Full SizeIt was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixotequitted the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most directroad to Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he tomake out this new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar.Well, as it fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him forsix days, at the end of which, having turned aside out of the road, hewas overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on thispoint Cide Hamete is not as precise as he usually is on other matters.Master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they hadsettled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a goodnoontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gatesof sleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger,kept awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and frothrough all sorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he wasin the cave of Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a countrywench, skipping and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words ofthe sage Merlin were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditionsto be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment ofDulcinea. He lost all patience when he considered the laziness and wantof charity of his squire Sancho; for to the best of his belief he hadonly given himself five lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned tothe vast number required. At this thought he felt such vexation andanger that he reasoned the matter thus: “If Alexander the Great cut theGordian knot, saying, ‘To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,’ andyet did not fail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more norless could happen now in Dulcinea’s disenchantment if I scourge Sanchoagainst his will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sanchoshall receive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to mewhether he inflicts them himself, or someone else inflicts them, whenthe essential point is that he receives them, let them come fromwhatever quarter they may?”With this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante’sreins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, andbegan to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one infront) by which his breeches were held up; but the instant heapproached him Sancho woke up in his full senses and cried out, “Whatis this? Who is touching me and untrussing me?”“It is I,” said Don Quixote, “and I come to make good thy shortcomingsand relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee, Sancho, and wipeoff some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. Dulcinea isperishing, thou art living on regardless, I am dying of hope deferred;therefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, inthis retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.”“Not a bit of it,” said Sancho; “let your worship keep quiet, or elseby the living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I pledged myselfto must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I have nofancy to whip myself; it is enough if I give you my word to flog andflap myself when I have a mind.”“It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,” said Don Quixote,“for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;” andat the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.Seeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped himwith all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heelstretched him on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee onhis chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move norbreathe.“How now, traitor!” exclaimed Don Quixote. “Dost thou revolt againstthy master and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him who gives theehis bread?”“I neither put down king, nor set up king,” said Sancho; “I only standup for myself who am my own lord; if your worship promises me to bequiet, and not to offer to whip me now, I’ll let you go free andunhindered; if not—Traitor and Doña Sancha’s foe,Thou diest on the spot.”Don Quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts notto touch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirelyfree and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.p60c.jpg (250K)Full SizeSancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he wasabout to place himself leaning against another tree he felt somethingtouch his head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody’s twofeet with shoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and madefor another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and hefell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. DonQuixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he wasafraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men’s feetand legs. Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, andsaid to Sancho, “Thou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet andlegs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to someoutlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for theauthorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties andthirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be nearBarcelona;” and it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first lightthey looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees werefreebooters’ bodies.And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, theirhearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who allof a sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them standand wait until their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with hishorse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in shortcompletely defenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his armsand bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion andopportunity. The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leavehim a single thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise;and lucky it was for Sancho that the duke’s crowns and those he broughtfrom home were in a girdle that he wore round him; but for all thatthese good folk would have stripped him, and even looked to see what hehad hidden between the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at thatmoment of their captain, who was about thirty-four years of ageapparently, strongly built, above the middle height, of stern aspectand swarthy complexion. He was mounted upon a powerful horse, and hadon a coat of mail, with four of the pistols they call petronels in thatcountry at his waist. He saw that his squires (for so they call thosewho follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he orderedthem to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped. Hewondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on theground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest andmost melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up tohim he said, “Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not falleninto the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart’s, whichare more merciful than cruel.”“The cause of my dejection,” returned Don Quixote, “is not that I havefallen into thy hands, O valiant Roque, whose fame is bounded by nolimits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been so greatthat thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty,according to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be alwayson the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee,great Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield,it would not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission,for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, he who hath filled the whole worldwith his achievements.”Roque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote’s weakness was moreakin to madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard himspoken of, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, norcould he persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant inthe heart of man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him andtest at close quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so hesaid to him, “Despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untowardfate the position in which thou findest thyself; it may be that bythese slips thy crooked fortune will make itself straight; for heavenby strange circuitous ways, mysterious and incomprehensible to man,raises up the fallen and makes rich the poor.”Don Quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noiseas of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on whichat a furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age,clad in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock,with a hat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polishedboots, gilt spurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and apair of pistols at his waist.Roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, whichdrawing near thus addressed him, “I came in quest of thee, valiantRoque, to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in mymisfortune; and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost notrecognise me, I will tell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, thedaughter of Simon Forte, thy good friend, and special enemy of ClauquelTorrellas, who is thine also as being of the faction opposed to thee.Thou knowest that this Torrellas has a son who is called, or at leastwas not two hours since, Don Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short thetale of my misfortune, I will tell thee in a few words what this youthhas brought upon me. He saw me, he paid court to me, I listened to him,and, unknown to my father, I loved him; for there is no woman, howeversecluded she may live or close she may be kept, who will not haveopportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses. In aword, he pledged himself to be mine, and I promised to be his, withoutcarrying matters any further. Yesterday I learned that, forgetful ofhis pledge to me, he was about to marry another, and that he was to gothis morning to plight his troth, intelligence which overwhelmed andexasperated me; my father not being at home I was able to adopt thiscostume you see, and urging my horse to speed I overtook Don Vicenteabout a league from this, and without waiting to utter reproaches orhear excuses I fired this musket at him, and these two pistols besides,and to the best of my belief I must have lodged more than two bulletsin his body, opening doors to let my honour go free, enveloped in hisblood. I left him there in the hands of his servants, who did not dareand were not able to interfere in his defence, and I come to seek fromthee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives with whom I canlive; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so that DonVicente’s numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak their lawlessvengeance upon him.”Roque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit,comely figure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her, “Come,señora, let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we willconsider what will be best for thee.” Don Quixote, who had beenlistening to what Claudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her,exclaimed, “Nobody need trouble himself with the defence of this lady,for I take it upon myself. Give me my horse and arms, and wait for mehere; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will makehim keep his word plighted to so great beauty.”“Nobody need have any doubt about that,” said Sancho, “for my masterhas a very happy knack of matchmaking; it’s not many days since heforced another man to marry, who in the same way backed out of hispromise to another maiden; and if it had not been for his persecutorsthe enchanters changing the man’s proper shape into a lacquey’s thesaid maiden would not be one this minute.”Roque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia’s adventurethan to the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering hissquires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, hedirected them to return to the place where they had been quarteredduring the night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in searchof the wounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot whereClaudia met him, but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood;looking all round, however, they descried some people on the slope of ahill above them, and concluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it wasDon Vicente, whom either dead or alive his servants were removing toattend to his wounds or to bury him. They made haste to overtake them,which, as the party moved slowly, they were able to do with ease. Theyfound Don Vicente in the arms of his servants, whom he was entreatingin a broken feeble voice to leave him there to die, as the pain of hiswounds would not suffer him to go any farther. Claudia and Roque threwthemselves off their horses and advanced towards him; the servants wereoverawed by the appearance of Roque, and Claudia was moved by the sightof Don Vicente, and going up to him half tenderly half sternly, sheseized his hand and said to him, “Hadst thou given me this according toour compact thou hadst never come to this pass.”The wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes, and recognisingClaudia said, “I see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it is thouthat hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelingstowards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee inthought or deed.”“It is not true, then,” said Claudia, “that thou wert going thismorning to marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?”“Assuredly not,” replied Don Vicente; “my cruel fortune must havecarried those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to take mylife; and to assure thyself of this, press my hands and take me for thyhusband if thou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer thee forthe wrong thou fanciest thou hast received from me.”Claudia wrung his hands, and her own heart was so wrung that she layfainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasmseized the same instant. Roque was in perplexity and knew not what todo; the servants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, andbrought some and bathed them with it. Claudia recovered from herfainting fit, but not so Don Vicente from the paroxysm that hadovertaken him, for his life had come to an end. On perceiving this,Claudia, when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was nomore, rent the air with her sighs and made the heavens ring with herlamentations; she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds, she beather face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrowthat could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart. “Cruel,reckless woman!” she cried, “how easily wert thou moved to carry out athought so wicked! O furious force of jealousy, to what desperatelengths dost thou lead those that give thee lodging in their bosoms! Ohusband, whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee from themarriage bed to the grave!”So vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that theydrew tears from Roque’s eyes, unused as they were to shed them on anyoccasion. The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, andthe whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune. Inthe end Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente’s servants to carry his bodyto his father’s village, which was close by, for burial. Claudia toldhim she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess,where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlastingspouse. He applauded her pious resolution, and offered to accompany herwhithersoever she wished, and to protect her father against the kinsmenof Don Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him.Claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her; andthanking him for his offers as well as she could, took leave of him intears. The servants of Don Vicente carried away his body, and Roquereturned to his comrades, and so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima;but what wonder, when it was the insuperable and cruel might ofjealousy that wove the web of her sad story?p60d.jpg (439K)Full SizeRoque Guinart found his squires at the place to which he had orderedthem, and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering aharangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life sofull of peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of themwere Gascons, rough lawless fellows, his speech did not make muchimpression on them. Roque on coming up asked Sancho if his men hadreturned and restored to him the treasures and jewels they had strippedoff Dapple. Sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that wereworth three cities were missing.“What are you talking about, man?” said one of the bystanders; “I havegot them, and they are not worth three reals.”“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “but my squire values them at therate he says, as having been given me by the person who gave them.”Roque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his menfall in in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money thatthey had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making ahasty valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, hemade shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in nocase did he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.When this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to DonQuixote, “If this scrupulous exactness were not observed with thesefellows there would be no living with them.”Upon this Sancho remarked, “From what I have seen here, justice is sucha good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thievesthemselves.”One of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of hisharquebuss would no doubt have broken Sancho’s head with it had notRoque Guinart called out to him to hold his hand. Sancho was frightenedout of his wits, and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was inthe company of these people.At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted assentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report whatpassed to their chief, came up and said, “Señor, there is a great troopof people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona.”To which Roque replied, “Hast thou made out whether they are of thesort that are after us, or of the sort we are after?”“The sort we are after,” said the squire.“Well then, away with you all,” said Roque, “and bring them here to meat once without letting one of them escape.”p60e.jpg (420K)Full SizeThey obeyed, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and Roque, left by themselves,waited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waitingRoque said to Don Quixote, “It must seem a strange sort of life toSeñor Don Quixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents,and all full of danger; and I do not wonder that it should seem so, forin truth I must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxiousthan ours. What led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance,which is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts. I am by naturetender-hearted and kindly, but, as I said, the desire to revenge myselffor a wrong that was done me so overturns all my better impulses that Ikeep on in this way of life in spite of what conscience tells me; andas one depth calls to another, and one sin to another sin, revengeshave linked themselves together, and I have taken upon myself not onlymy own but those of others: it pleases God, however, that, though I seemyself in this maze of entanglements, I do not lose all hope ofescaping from it and reaching a safe port.”Don Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and justsentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed suchtrades as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyonecapable of a virtuous thought, and he said in reply, “Señor Roque, thebeginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man’swillingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; youare sick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speakingGod, who is our physician, will administer medicines that will cureyou, and cure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides,sinners of discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools;and as your worship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you haveto do is to keep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of yourconscience will be strengthened. And if you have any desire to shortenthe journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come withme, and I will show you how to become a knight-errant, a callingwherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they betaken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice.”Roque laughed at Don Quixote’s exhortation, and changing theconversation he related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at whichSancho was extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman’sbeauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss.And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing withthem two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach fullof women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendanceon them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them.The squires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquishedmaintaining profound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart tospeak. He asked the gentlemen who they were, whither they were going,and what money they carried with them; “Señor,” replied one of them,“we are two captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples,and we are on our way to embark in four galleys which they say are atBarcelona under orders for Sicily; and we have about two or threehundred crowns, with which we are, according to our notions, rich andcontented, for a soldier’s poverty does not allow a more extensivehoard.”Roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains,and was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and thatbetween them they might have about sixty reals. He asked also who wasin the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and oneof the men on horseback replied, “The persons in the coach are my ladyDoña Guiomar de Quiñones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples,her little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are inattendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.”“So then,” said Roque Guinart, “we have got here nine hundred crownsand sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much therefalls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.” As soon as the robbersheard this they raised a shout of “Long life to Roque Guinart, in spiteof the lladres that seek his ruin!”The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent’s ladywas downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing theirproperty confiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for awhile; but he had no desire to prolong their distress, which might beseen a bowshot off, and turning to the captains he said, “Sirs, willyour worships be pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, andher ladyship the regent’s wife eighty, to satisfy this band thatfollows me, for ‘it is by his singing the abbot gets his dinner;’ andthen you may at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, witha safe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across anyother bands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may doyou no harm; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or toany woman, especially one of quality.”Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which thecaptains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such theyregarded his leaving them their own money. Señora Doña Guiomar deQuiñones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet andhands of the great Roque, but he would not suffer it on any account; sofar from that, he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her underpressure of the inexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling. Theregent’s lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crownsthat had been assessed as her share at once, for the captains hadalready paid down their sixty. The pilgrims were about to give up thewhole of their little hoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, andturning to his men he said, “Of these crowns two fall to each man andtwenty remain over; let ten be given to these pilgrims, and the otherten to this worthy squire that he may be able to speak favourably ofthis adventure;” and then having writing materials, with which healways went provided, brought to him, he gave them in writing asafe-conduct to the leaders of his bands; and bidding them farewell letthem go free and filled with admiration at his magnanimity, hisgenerous disposition, and his unusual conduct, and inclined to regardhim as an Alexander the Great rather than a notorious robber.One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, “Thiscaptain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wantsto be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and notours.”p60f.jpg (426K)Full SizeThe unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him,and drawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, “That isthe way I punish impudent saucy fellows.” They were all taken aback,and not one of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they payhim. Roque then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend ofhis at Barcelona, telling him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha,the knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, andwas, he assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and thatin four days from that date, that is to say, on Saint John theBaptist’s Day, he was going to deposit him in full armour mounted onhis horse Rocinante, together with his squire Sancho on an ass, in themiddle of the strand of the city; and bidding him give notice of thisto his friends the Niarros, that they might divert themselves with him.He wished, he said, his enemies the Cadells could be deprived of thispleasure; but that was impossible, because the crazes and shrewdsayings of Don Quixote and the humours of his squire Sancho Panza couldnot help giving general pleasure to all the world. He despatched theletter by one of his squires, who, exchanging the costume of ahighwayman for that of a peasant, made his way into Barcelona and gaveit to the person to whom it was directed.p60g.jpg (42K)CHAPTER LXI.OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHERMATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE RATHER THAN OF THE INGENIOUSp61a.jpg (143K)Full SizeDon Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had hepassed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe andwonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, atdinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom,at other times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They sleptstanding, breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. Therewas nothing but sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels andblowing the matches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, foralmost all used flintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place orother apart from his men, that they might not know where he was, forthe many proclamations the viceroy of Barcelona had issued against hislife kept him in fear and uneasiness, and he did not venture to trustanyone, afraid that even his own men would kill him or deliver him upto the authorities; of a truth, a weary miserable life! At length, byunfrequented roads, short cuts, and secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote,and Sancho, together with six squires, set out for Barcelona. Theyreached the strand on Saint John’s Eve during the night; and Roque,after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to whom he presented the tencrowns he had promised but had not until then given), left them withmany expressions of good-will on both sides.Roque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as hewas, waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of thefair Aurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east,gladdening the grass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladdenthat too there came at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums,and a din of bells, and a tramp, tramp, and cries of “Clear the waythere!” of some runners, that seemed to issue from the city.p61b.jpg (271K)Full SizeThe dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a bucklerbegan to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote andSancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until thenunseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, muchmore so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha.They saw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings,displayed themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled inthe breeze and kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles,trumpets, and clarions were sounding and filling the air far and nearwith melodious warlike notes. Then they began to move and execute akind of skirmish upon the calm water, while a vast number of horsemenon fine horses and in showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged ontheir side in a somewhat similar movement. The soldiers on board thegalleys kept up a ceaseless fire, which they on the walls and forts ofthe city returned, and the heavy cannon rent the air with thetremendous noise they made, to which the gangway guns of the galleysreplied. The bright sea, the smiling earth, the clear air—though attimes darkened by the smoke of the guns—all seemed to fill the wholemultitude with unexpected delight. Sancho could not make out how it wasthat those great masses that moved over the sea had so many feet.And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts andoutlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed andwondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressinghim exclaimed, “Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosureof all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiantDon Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, theapocryphal, that these latter days have offered us in lying histories,but the true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli,flower of historians, has described to us!”Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, butwheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting roundDon Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, “These gentlemen haveplainly recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, andeven that newly printed one by the Aragonese.”The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him andsaid, “Come with us, Señor Don Quixote, for we are all of us yourservants and great friends of Roque Guinart’s;” to which Don Quixotereturned, “If courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughteror very nearly akin to the great Roque’s; carry me where you please; Iwill have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it inyour service.”p61c.jpg (448K)Full SizeThe cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closingin around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of theclarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the wicked one, whois the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than thewicked one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressibleurchins should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, oneof them Dapple’s tail and the other Rocinante’s, insert a bunch offurze under each. The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added totheir anguish by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting amultitude of capers, they flung their masters to the ground. DonQuixote, covered with shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck theplume from his poor jade’s tail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple.His conductors tried to punish the audacity of the boys, but there wasno possibility of doing so, for they hid themselves among the hundredsof others that were following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted oncemore, and with the same music and acclamations reached theirconductor’s house, which was large and stately, that of a richgentleman, in short; and there for the present we will leave them, forsuch is Cide Hamete’s pleasure.p61e.jpg (32K)CHAPTER LXII.WHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD, TOGETHER WITHOTHER TRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE LEFT UNTOLDp62a.jpg (156K)Full SizeDon Quixote’s host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman ofwealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fairand good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set aboutdevising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmlessfashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worthanything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to make DonQuixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suitwe have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balconyoverhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of thecrowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. Thecavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for himalone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it,and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knewnot, he had fallen upon another Camacho’s wedding, another house likeDon Diego de Miranda’s, another castle like the duke’s. Some of DonAntonio’s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to DonQuixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed upand exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction.Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house,and all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at tableDon Antonio said to him, “We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fondof manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, youkeep them in your bosom for the next day.”“No, señor, that’s not true,” said Sancho, “for I am more cleanly thangreedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are usedto live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it sohappens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eatwhat I’m given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; butwhoever says that I’m an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let metell him that he is wrong; and I’d put it in a different way if I didnot respect the honourable beards that are at the table.”“Indeed,” said Don Quixote, “Sancho’s moderation and cleanliness ineating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept ineternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true that when he is hungrythere is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for he eats at agreat pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is alwaysmindful of; and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily, somuch so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork.”“What!” said Don Antonio, “has Sancho been a governor?”“Ay,” said Sancho, “and of an island called Barataria. I governed it toperfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned tolook down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it bytaking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead,and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.”Don Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair ofSancho’s government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.On the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand,passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in theway of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on apedestal of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of thebusts of the Roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. DonAntonio traversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked roundthe table several times, and then said, “Now, Señor Don Quixote, that Iam satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut,I will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properlyspeaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that youwill keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.”“I swear it,” said Don Quixote, “and for greater security I will put aflag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Señor Don Antonio” (hehad by this time learned his name), “that you are addressing one who,though he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you maysafely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and relyupon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence.”“In reliance upon that promise,” said Don Antonio, “I will astonish youwith what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of thevexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets,for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.”Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of suchprecautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over thebronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which itstood, and then said, “This head, Señor Don Quixote, has been made andfabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world eversaw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotilloof whom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, andfor a consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructedthis head, which has the property and virtue of answering whateverquestions are put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, hetraced figures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments,and at length brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, foron Fridays it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the nextday. In the interval your worship may consider what you would like toask it; and I know by experience that in all its answers it tells thetruth.”Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and wasinclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he hadto wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything exceptthat he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. Theythen quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repairedto the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In themeantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures andaccidents that had happened his master.That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in hisarmour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him,that at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were leftwith the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave thehouse. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall muleof easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him,and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchmenton which they wrote in large letters, “This is Don Quixote of LaMancha.” As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted theeyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, “This is DonQuixote of La Mancha,” Don Quixote was amazed to see how many peoplegazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turningto Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, “Great arethe privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professesit known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio,even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.”“True, Señor Don Quixote,” returned Don Antonio; “for as fire cannot behidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and thatwhich is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished aboveall others.”It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid theacclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading theinscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, “The devil takethee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not deadof the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad;and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, itwould not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools andblockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee.Why, look at these gentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home,blockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy wife and children, andgive over these fooleries that are sapping thy brains and skimming awaythy wits.”“Go your own way, brother,” said Don Antonio, “and don’t offer adviceto those who don’t ask you for it. Señor Don Quixote is in his fullsenses, and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is to behonoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don’tmeddle where you are not wanted.”“By God, your worship is right,” replied the Castilian; “for to advisethis good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that itfills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has ineverything should dribble away by the channel of his knight-errantry;but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me and all mydescendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live longer thanMethuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks me for it.”The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; butso great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, thatDon Antonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off somethingelse.p62b.jpg (373K)Full SizeNight came and they went home, and there was a ladies’ dancing party,for Don Antonio’s wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, hadinvited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest andamuse themselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came, theysupped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o’clock. Among theladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, thoughperfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmlessdiversion’s sake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixoteout to dance that they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit.It was a sight to see the figure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean,and yellow, his garments clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above allanything but agile.p62c.jpg (342K)Full SizeThe gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretlyrepelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishmentshe lifted up his voice and exclaimed, “_Fugite, partes adversæ!_ Leaveme in peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies,for she who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffersnone but hers to lead me captive and subdue me;” and so saying he satdown on the floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken downby all this exertion in the dance.Don Antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, andthe first that laid hold of him was Sancho, saying as he did so, “In anevil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty menof valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If youdo, I can tell you you are mistaken; there’s many a man would ratherundertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been theshoe-fling you were at I could take your place, for I can do theshoe-fling like a gerfalcon; but I’m no good at dancing.”With these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-roomlaughing, and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so thathe might sweat out any chill caught after his dancing.The next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of theenchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friendsof his, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at theball, who had remained for the night with Don Antonio’s wife, he lockedhimself up in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them theproperty it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling themthat now for the first time he was going to try the virtue of theenchanted head; but except Don Antonio’s two friends no one else wasprivy to the mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had notfirst revealed it to them they would have been inevitably reduced tothe same state of amazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully wasit contrived.The first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, andin a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said toit, “Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at thismoment thinking of?”The head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear anddistinct voice, so as to be heard by all, “I cannot judge of thoughts.”All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw thatthere was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room thatcould have answered. “How many of us are here?” asked Don Antonio oncemore; and it was answered him in the same way softly, “Thou and thywife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knightcalled Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza byname.”Now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone’s hair was standing onend with awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, “Thissuffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold theeto me, O sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Letsomeone else go and put what question he likes to it.”And as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to comeforward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio’s wife, and herquestion was, “Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?”and the answer she got was, “Be very modest.”“I question thee no further,” said the fair querist.Her companion then came up and said, “I should like to know, Head,whether my husband loves me or not;” the answer given to her was,“Think how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;” and the married ladywent off saying, “That answer did not need a question; for of coursethe treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it isreceived.”Then one of Don Antonio’s two friends advanced and asked it, “Who amI?” “Thou knowest,” was the answer. “That is not what I ask thee,” saidthe gentleman, “but to tell me if thou knowest me.” “Yes, I know thee,thou art Don Pedro Noriz,” was the reply.“I do not seek to know more,” said the gentleman, “for this is enoughto convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;” and as heretired the other friend came forward and asked it, “Tell me, Head,what are the wishes of my eldest son?”“I have said already,” was the answer, “that I cannot judge of wishes;however, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury thee.”“That’s ‘what I see with my eyes I point out with my finger,’” said thegentleman, “so I ask no more.”Don Antonio’s wife came up and said, “I know not what to ask thee,Head; I would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years ofenjoyment of my good husband;” and the answer she received was, “Thoushalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years oflife, which by their intemperance others so often cut short.”Then Don Quixote came forward and said, “Tell me, thou that answerest,was that which I describe as having happened to me in the cave ofMontesinos the truth or a dream? Will Sancho’s whipping be accomplishedwithout fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about?”p62d.jpg (391K)Full Size“As to the question of the cave,” was the reply, “there is much to besaid; there is something of both in it. Sancho’s whipping will proceedleisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its dueconsummation.”“I seek to know no more,” said Don Quixote; “let me but see Dulcineadisenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune I couldwish for has come upon me all at once.”The last questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, “Head, shall Iby any chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from thehard life of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?”To which the answer came, “Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thoureturnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing toserve thou shalt cease to be a squire.”“Good, by God!” said Sancho Panza; “I could have told myself that; theprophet Perogrullo could have said no more.”“What answer wouldst thou have, beast?” said Don Quixote; “is it notenough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put toit?”“Yes, it is enough,” said Sancho; “but I should have liked it to havemade itself plainer and told me more.”The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder withwhich all were filled, except Don Antonio’s two friends who were in thesecret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, notto keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strangemagical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of anotherhead, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, DonAntonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonishignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was ofwood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on whichit stood was of the same material, with four eagles’ claws projectingfrom it to support the weight more steadily. The head, which resembleda bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, washollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted soexactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of thetable was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of thehead, and the whole was in communication with another room underneaththe chamber in which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in thepedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed atube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the roombelow corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was toanswer, with his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in anear-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from below upwards, thewords coming clearly and distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detectthe trick. A nephew of Don Antonio’s, a smart sharp-witted student, wasthe answerer, and as he had been told beforehand by his uncle who thepersons were that would come with him that day into the chamber wherethe head was, it was an easy matter for him to answer the firstquestion at once and correctly; the others he answered by guess-work,and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete adds that this marvellouscontrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it becamenoised abroad through the city that he had in his house an enchantedhead that answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearingit might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith,explained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him to break itup and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should bescandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was stillheld to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, thoughmore to Don Quixote’s satisfaction than Sancho’s.The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do thehonours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying hisfolly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days fromthat time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter,did not take place.Don Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot,for he feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him;so he and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out fora walk. Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets DonQuixote lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over adoor, “Books printed here,” at which he was vastly pleased, for untilthen he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to knowwhat it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw themdrawing sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up typehere, revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in greatprinting offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were aboutthere; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passedon. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he wasdoing. The workman replied, “Señor, this gentleman here” (pointing to aman of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) “hastranslated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting itup in type for the press.”“What is the title of the book?” asked Don Quixote; to which the authorreplied, “Señor, in Italian the book is called _Le Bagatelle_.”“And what does _Le Bagatelle_ import in our Spanish?” asked DonQuixote.“_Le Bagatelle_,” said the author, “is as though we should say inSpanish _Los Juguetes;_ but though the book is humble in name it hasgood solid matter in it.”“I,” said Don Quixote, “have some little smattering of Italian, and Iplume myself on singing some of Ariosto’s stanzas; but tell me, señor—Ido not say this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity—haveyou ever met with the word _pignatta_ in your book?”“Yes, often,” said the author.“And how do you render that in Spanish?”“How should I render it,” returned the author, “but by _olla_?”“Body o’ me,” exclaimed Don Quixote, “what a proficient you are in theItalian language! I would lay a good wager that where they say inItalian _piace_ you say in Spanish _place_, and where they say _piu_you say _mas_, and you translate _sù_ by _arriba_ and _giù_ by_abajo_.”“I translate them so of course,” said the author, “for those are theirproper equivalents.”“I would venture to swear,” said Don Quixote, “that your worship is notknown in the world, which always begrudges their reward to rare witsand praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What geniusthrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems tome that translation from one language into another, if it be not fromthe queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking atFlemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures arevisible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and theydo not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; andtranslation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command ofwords, any more than transcribing or copying out one document fromanother. But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no creditis to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may employhimself in ways worse and less profitable to himself. This estimatedoes not include two famous translators, Doctor Cristóbal de Figueroa,in his _Pastor Fido_, and Don Juan de Jáuregui, in his _Aminta_,wherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is thetranslation and which the original. But tell me, are you printing thisbook at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to somebookseller?”“I print at my own risk,” said the author, “and I expect to make athousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to be of twothousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece.”“A fine calculation you are making!” said Don Quixote; “it is plain youdon’t know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they play into oneanother’s hands. I promise you when you find yourself saddled with twothousand copies you will feel so sore that it will astonish you,particularly if the book is a little out of the common and not in anyway highly spiced.”“What!” said the author, “would your worship, then, have me give it toa bookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyright and thinkhe is doing me a favour? I do not print my books to win fame in theworld, for I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money,without which reputation is not worth a rap.”“God send your worship good luck,” said Don Quixote; and he moved on toanother case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a book with thetitle of “Light of the Soul;” noticing it he observed, “Books likethis, though there are many of the kind, are the ones that deserve tobe printed, for many are the sinners in these days, and lightsunnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness.”He passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and whenhe asked its title they told him it was called, “The Second Part of theIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,” by one of Tordesillas.“I have heard of this book already,” said Don Quixote, “and verily andon my conscience I thought it had been by this time burned to ashes asa meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as it does toevery pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about them themore nearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and truestories, the truer they are the better they are;” and so saying hewalked out of the printing office with a certain amount of displeasurein his looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged to take him to see thegalleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, ashe had never seen any all his life. Don Antonio sent word to thecommandant of the galleys that he intended to bring his guest, thefamous Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom the commandant and all thecitizens had already heard, that afternoon to see them; and whathappened on board of them will be told in the next chapter.p62e.jpg (18K)CHAPTER LXIII.OF THE MISHAP THAT BEFELL SANCHO PANZA THROUGH THE VISIT TO THEGALLEYS, AND THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF THE FAIR MORISCOp63a.jpg (151K)Full SizeProfound were Don Quixote’s reflections on the reply of the enchantedhead, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of the trick, butall concentrated on the promise, which he regarded as a certainty, ofDulcinea’s disenchantment. This he turned over in his mind again andagain with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he would shortlysee its fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has been said, hehated being a governor, still he had a longing to be giving orders andfinding himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that being inauthority, even in jest, brings with it.To resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his twofriends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys. Thecommandant had been already made aware of his good fortune in seeingtwo such famous persons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant theycame to the shore all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarionsrang out. A skiff covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimsonvelvet was immediately lowered into the water, and as Don Quixotestepped on board of it, the leading galley fired her gangway gun, andthe other galleys did the same; and as he mounted the starboard ladderthe whole crew saluted him (as is the custom when a personage ofdistinction comes on board a galley) by exclaiming “Hu, hu, hu,” threetimes. The general, for so we shall call him, a Valencian gentleman ofrank, gave him his hand and embraced him, saying, “I shall mark thisday with a white stone as one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy inmy lifetime, since I have seen Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, patternand image wherein we see contained and condensed all that is worthy inknight-errantry.”Don Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception,replied to him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to thepoop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on thebulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped allhands to strip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such anumber of men stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still morewhen he saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him asif all the devils were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancybread to what I am going to tell now. Sancho was seated on thecaptain’s stage, close to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side.He, previously instructed in what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho,hoisting him up in his arms, and the whole crew, who were standingready, beginning on the right, proceeded to pass him on, whirling himalong from hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity thatit took the sight out of poor Sancho’s eyes, and he made quite surethat the devils themselves were flying away with him; nor did theyleave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side anddeposited him on the poop; and the poor fellow was left bruised andbreathless and all in a sweat, and unable to comprehend what it wasthat had happened to him.Don Quixote when he saw Sancho’s flight without wings asked the generalif this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleysfor the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting themas a profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, andif anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed toGod he would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up andclapped his hand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awningand lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heavenwas coming off its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full ofterror he ducked it and buried it between his knees; nor were DonQuixote’s knees altogether under control, for he too shook a little,squeezed his shoulders together and lost colour. The crew then hoistedthe yard with the same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it,all the while keeping silence as though they had neither voice norbreath. The boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping uponthe middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crewwith his courbash or whip, and to haul out gradually to sea.When Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be)moving all together, he said to himself, “It’s these that are the realchanted things, and not the ones my master talks of. What can thosewretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goesalong there whistling dare to whip so many? I declare this is hell, orat least purgatory!”Don Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was goingon, said to him, “Ah, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply mightyou finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip tothe waist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain andsufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreoverperhaps the sage Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid onwith a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must giveyourself at last.”The general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what wasDulcinea’s disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, “Monjui signalsthat there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.”On hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, “Now then,my sons, don’t let her give us the slip! It must be some Algerinecorsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us.” The three othersimmediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders.The general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other keptin shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. Thecrews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemedto fly. The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of milessighted a vessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged tobe one of fourteen or fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as thevessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object and in thehope of making her escape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for thechief galley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled herso rapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly there was nopossibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had themdrop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captainin command of our galleys to anger. But chance, directing thingsotherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came closeenough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from hercalling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks,both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine,discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined thesides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he would not leaveone of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore downfuriously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. Thegalley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their casewas desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail,and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but theiractivity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm,for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a milethrew her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The othertwo galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize tothe beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to seewhat they brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceivedthat the viceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff topush off to fetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose ofhanging forthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board thevessel, about six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most ofthem Turkish musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine,and was answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwardsproved to be a Spanish renegade), “This young man, señor, that you seehere is our rais,” and he pointed to one of the handsomest and mostgallant-looking youths that could be imagined. He did not seem to betwenty years of age.“Tell me, dog,” said the general, “what led thee to kill my soldiers,when thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape? Is that the wayto behave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness is notvalour? Faint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.”The rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that momentlisten to him, as he had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was nowcoming on board the galley, and with him certain of his attendants andsome of the people.“You have had a good chase, señor general,” said the viceroy.“Your excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up to thisyard,” replied the general.“How so?” returned the viceroy.“Because,” said the general, “against all law, reason, and usages ofwar they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on boardthese galleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken,but above all this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,” and hepointed to him as he stood with his hands already bound and the roperound his neck, ready for death.The viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, sograceful, and so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, thecomeliness of the youth furnishing him at once with a letter ofrecommendation. He therefore questioned him, saying, “Tell me, rais,art thou Turk, Moor, or renegade?”To which the youth replied, also in Spanish, “I am neither Turk, norMoor, nor renegade.”“What art thou, then?” said the viceroy.“A Christian woman,” replied the youth.“A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances! Itis more marvellous than credible,” said the viceroy.“Suspend the execution of the sentence,” said the youth; “yourvengeance will not lose much by waiting while I tell you the story ofmy life.”What heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, atany rate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? Thegeneral bade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for hisflagrant offence. With this permission the youth began in these words.“Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than wise,upon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course of ourmisfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it wasin vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not amere pretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. Itavailed me nothing with those charged with our sad expatriation toprotest this, nor would my uncles believe it; on the contrary, theytreated it as an untruth and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remainbehind in the land of my birth; and so, more by force than of my ownwill, they took me with them. I had a Christian mother, and a fatherwho was a man of sound sense and a Christian too; I imbibed theCatholic faith with my mother’s milk, I was well brought up, andneither in word nor in deed did I, I think, show any sign of being aMorisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I hold them, my beauty,if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as was the seclusionin which I lived it was not so great but that a young gentleman, DonGaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who is lord of avillage near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing me. How hesaw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not keptfrom him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I amin dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongueand throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose toaccompany me in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoeswho were going forth from other villages, for he knew their languagevery well, and on the voyage he struck up a friendship with my twouncles who were carrying me with them; for my father, like a wise andfar-sighted man, as soon as he heard the first edict for our expulsion,quitted the village and departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad.He left hidden and buried, at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, alarge quantity of pearls and precious stones of great value, togetherwith a sum of money in gold cruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me onno account to touch the treasure, if by any chance they expelled usbefore his return. I obeyed him, and with my uncles, as I have said,and others of our kindred and neighbours, passed over to Barbary, andthe place where we took up our abode was Algiers, much the same as ifwe had taken it up in hell itself. The king heard of my beauty, andreport told him of my wealth, which was in some degree fortunate forme. He summoned me before him, and asked me what part of Spain I camefrom, and what money and jewels I had. I mentioned the place, and toldhim the jewels and money were buried there; but that they might easilybe recovered if I myself went back for them. All this I told him, indread lest my beauty and not his own covetousness should influence him.While he was engaged in conversation with me, they brought him wordthat in company with me was one of the handsomest and most gracefulyouths that could be imagined. I knew at once that they were speakingof Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the most highlyvaunted beauty. I was troubled when I thought of the danger he was in,for among those barbarous Turks a fair youth is more esteemed than awoman, be she ever so beautiful. The king immediately ordered him to bebrought before him that he might see him, and asked me if what theysaid about the youth was true. I then, almost as if inspired by heaven,told him it was, but that I would have him to know it was not a man,but a woman like myself, and I entreated him to allow me to go anddress her in the attire proper to her, so that her beauty might be seento perfection, and that she might present herself before him with lessembarrassment. He bade me go by all means, and said that the next daywe should discuss the plan to be adopted for my return to Spain tocarry away the hidden treasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him the dangerhe was in if he let it be seen he was a man, I dressed him as a Moorishwoman, and that same afternoon I brought him before the king, who wascharmed when he saw him, and resolved to keep the damsel and make apresent of her to the Grand Signor; and to avoid the risk she might runamong the women of his seraglio, and distrustful of himself, hecommanded her to be placed in the house of some Moorish ladies of rankwho would protect and attend to her; and thither he was taken at once.What we both suffered (for I cannot deny that I love him) may be leftto the imagination of those who are separated if they love one anotherdearly. The king then arranged that I should return to Spain in thisbrigantine, and that two Turks, those who killed your soldiers, shouldaccompany me. There also came with me this Spanish renegade”—and hereshe pointed to him who had first spoken—“whom I know to be secretly aChristian, and to be more desirous of being left in Spain than ofreturning to Barbary. The rest of the crew of the brigantine are Moorsand Turks, who merely serve as rowers. The two Turks, greedy andinsolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me and thisrenegade in Christian dress (with which we came provided) on the firstSpanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and make someprize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, wemight, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that thebrigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys onthe coast, they might be taken. We sighted this shore last night, andknowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the resultwas what you have seen. To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman’sdress, among women, in imminent danger of his life; and here am I, withhands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, ofwhich I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as itis unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian,for, as I have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence ofwhich those of my nation are guilty;” and she stood silent, her eyesfilled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders.The viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her without speakingand untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl.But all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story,an elderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the sametime as the viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant sheceased speaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them saidin a voice broken by sobs and sighs, “O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter,I am thy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to livewithout thee, my soul that thou art!”At these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head,which he had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion;and looking at the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he metthe day he quitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was hisdaughter. She being now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tearswith his, while he addressing the general and the viceroy said, “This,sirs, is my daughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name.She is Ana Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her ownbeauty as for my wealth. I quitted my native land in search of someshelter or refuge for us abroad, and having found one in Germany Ireturned in this pilgrim’s dress, in the company of some other Germanpilgrims, to seek my daughter and take up a large quantity of treasureI had left buried. My daughter I did not find, the treasure I found andhave with me; and now, in this strange roundabout way you have seen, Ifind the treasure that more than all makes me rich, my beloveddaughter. If our innocence and her tears and mine can with strictjustice open the door to clemency, extend it to us, for we never hadany intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise with the aims ofour people, who have been justly banished.”“I know Ricote well,” said Sancho at this, “and I know too that what hesays about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but as to those otherparticulars about going and coming, and having good or bad intentions,I say nothing.”While all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the generalsaid, “At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath; live,fair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but theserash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they havecommitted;” and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks who hadkilled his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy,however, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behavioursavoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to theviceroy’s request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood. Theythen tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio fromthe danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that objectmore than two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; theyproposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by therenegade already mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a smallvessel of about six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knewwhere, how, and when he could and should land, nor was he ignorant ofthe house in which Don Gaspar was staying. The general and the viceroyhad some hesitation about placing confidence in the renegade andentrusting him with the Christians who were to row, but Ana Felix saidshe could answer for him, and her father offered to go and pay theransom of the Christians if by any chance they should not beforthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon, the viceroy landed, and DonAntonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her father home with him, theviceroy charging him to give them the best reception and welcome in hispower, while on his own part he offered all that house contained fortheir entertainment; so great was the good-will and kindliness thebeauty of Ana Felix had infused into his heart.p63e.jpg (23K)CHAPTER LXIV.TREATING OF THE ADVENTURE WHICH GAVE DON QUIXOTE MORE UNHAPPINESS THANALL THAT HAD HITHERTO BEFALLEN HIMp64a.jpg (80K)Full SizeThe wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremelyhappy to see Ana Felix in her house. She welcomed her with greatkindness, charmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for inboth respects the fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the peopleof the city flocked to see her as though they had been summoned by theringing of the bells.Don Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing DonGregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than itsadvantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his armsand horse in Barbary; for he would carry him off in spite of the wholeMoorish host, as Don Gaiferos carried off his wife Melisendra.“Remember, your worship,” observed Sancho on hearing him say so, “SeñorDon Gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, and took her toFrance by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off DonGregorio, we have no way of bringing him to Spain, for there’s the seabetween.”“There’s a remedy for everything except death,” said Don Quixote; “ifthey bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be able to get onboard though all the world strive to prevent us.”“Your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,” said Sancho;“but ‘it’s a long step from saying to doing;’ and I hold to therenegade, for he seems to me an honest good-hearted fellow.”Don Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful,the expedient of the great Don Quixote’s expedition to Barbary shouldbe adopted. Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a lightvessel of six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days laterthe galleys made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroyto let him know all about the release of Don Gregorio and about AnaFelix, and the viceroy promised to do as he requested.One morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach,arrayed in full armour (for, as he often said, that was “his only gear,his only rest the fray,” and he never was without it for a moment), hesaw coming towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shiningmoon painted on his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to beheard, said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote,“Illustrious knight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of LaMancha, I am the Knight of the White Moon, whose unheard-ofachievements will perhaps have recalled him to thy memory. I come to dobattle with thee and prove the might of thy arm, to the end that I makethee acknowledge and confess that my lady, let her be who she may, isincomparably fairer than thy Dulcinea del Toboso. If thou dostacknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shalt escape death and save methe trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thou fightest and I vanquishthee, I demand no other satisfaction than that, laying aside arms andabstaining from going in quest of adventures, thou withdraw and betakethyself to thine own village for the space of a year, and live therewithout putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet and beneficialrepose, the same being needful for the increase of thy substance andthe salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, my head shallbe at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the renown of mydeeds transferred and added to thine. Consider which will be thy bestcourse, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the time Ihave for the despatch of this business.”Don Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of theWhite Moon’s arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance,and with calm dignity he answered him, “Knight of the White Moon, ofwhose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture toswear you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seenher I know you would have taken care not to venture yourself upon thisissue, because the sight would have removed all doubt from your mindthat there ever has been or can be a beauty to be compared with hers;and so, not saying you lie, but merely that you are not correct in whatyou state, I accept your challenge, with the conditions you haveproposed, and at once, that the day you have fixed may not expire; andfrom your conditions I except only that of the renown of yourachievements being transferred to me, for I know not of what sort theyare nor what they may amount to; I am satisfied with my own, such asthey be. Take, therefore, the side of the field you choose, and I willdo the same; and to whom God shall give it may Saint Peter add hisblessing.”The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it wastold the viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. Theviceroy, fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don AntonioMoreno or some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to thebeach accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just asDon Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up thenecessary distance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of themwere evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself betweenthem, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all ofa sudden in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it wasa question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he hadsaid to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed uponon both sides had been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio,and asked in a low voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moonwas, or was it some joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonioreplied that he neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was injoke or in earnest. This answer left the viceroy in a state ofperplexity, not knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on ornot; but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke hefell back, saying, “If there be no other way out of it, gallantknights, except to confess or die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, andyour worship of the White Moon still more so, in God’s hand be it, andfall on.”He of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosenwords for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, whothen, commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to hisDulcinea, as was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him,proceeded to take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist wasdoing the same; then, without blast of trumpet or other warlikeinstrument to give them the signal to charge, both at the same instantwheeled their horses; and he of the White Moon, being the swifter, metDon Quixote after having traversed two-thirds of the course, and thereencountered him with such violence that, without touching him with hislance (for he held it high, to all appearance purposely), he hurled DonQuixote and Rocinante to the earth, a perilous fall. He sprang upon himat once, and placing the lance over his visor said to him, “You arevanquished, sir knight, nay dead unless you admit the conditions of ourdefiance.”Don Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in aweak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, “Dulcinea delToboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunateknight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by myfeebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, sinceyou have taken away my honour.”“That will I not, in sooth,” said he of the White Moon; “live the fameof the lady Dulcinea’s beauty undimmed as ever; all I require is thatthe great Don Quixote retire to his own home for a year, or for so longa time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we agreed beforeengaging in this combat.”The viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard allthis, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing inprejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all therest like a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of theWhite Moon wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with amovement of the head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. Theviceroy bade Don Antonio hasten after him, and by some means or otherfind out who he was. They raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his face,and found him pale and bathed with sweat.p64b.jpg (344K)Full SizeRocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stirfor the present. Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not whatto say or do. He fancied that all was a dream, that the whole businesswas a piece of enchantment. Here was his master defeated, and bound notto take up arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of hisachievements obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him sweptaway like smoke before the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled forlife, and his master’s bones out of joint; for if he were only shakenout of his madness it would be no small luck. In the end they carriedhim into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, andthither the viceroy himself returned, eager to ascertain who thisKnight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sadplight.p64e.jpg (44K)Full SizeCHAPTER LXV.WHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS; LIKEWISEDON GREGORIO’S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTSp65a.jpg (149K)Full SizeDon Antonio Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a numberof boys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairlyhoused in a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to makehis acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him andremove his armour, and he shut himself into a lower room, stillattended by Don Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he had foundout who he was. He of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentlemanwould not leave him, said, “I know very well, señor, what you have comefor; it is to find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I shouldconceal it from you, while my servant here is taking off my armour Iwill tell you the true state of the case, without leaving out anything.You must know, señor, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. Iam of the same village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze andfolly make all of us who know him feel pity for him, and I am one ofthose who have felt it most; and persuaded that his chance of recoverylay in quiet and keeping at home and in his own house, I hit upon adevice for keeping him there. Three months ago, therefore, I went outto meet him as a knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight ofthe Mirrors, intending to engage him in combat and overcome him withouthurting him, making it the condition of our combat that the vanquishedshould be at the disposal of the victor. What I meant to demand of him(for I regarded him as vanquished already) was that he should return tohis own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time hemight be cured. But fate ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me andunhorsed me, and so my plan failed. He went his way, and I came backconquered, covered with shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which wasa particularly dangerous one. But this did not quench my desire to meethim again and overcome him, as you have seen to-day. And as he is soscrupulous in his observance of the laws of knight-errantry, he will,no doubt, in order to keep his word, obey the injunction I have laidupon him. This, señor, is how the matter stands, and I have nothingmore to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, or tell DonQuixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful, andthat a man of excellent wits—were he only rid of the fooleries ofchivalry—may get them back again.”“O señor,” said Don Antonio, “may God forgive you the wrong you havedone the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in itback to his senses. Do you not see, señor, that the gain by DonQuixote’s sanity can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? But mybelief is that all the señor bachelor’s pains will be of no avail tobring a man so hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it werenot uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for byhis recovery we lose not only his own drolleries, but his squire SanchoPanza’s too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itself intomerriment. However, I’ll hold my peace and say nothing to him, andwe’ll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Señor Carrasco’sefforts will be fruitless.”The bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, andhe hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at DonAntonio’s commands he took his leave of him; and having had his armourpacked at once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day onthe horse he rode to battle, and returned to his own country withoutmeeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and theviceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote’sretirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anythingof his mad doings.Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody andout of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sanchostrove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, “Hold upyour head, señor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks toheaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not comeoff with a broken rib; and, as you know that ‘where they give theytake,’ and that ‘there are not always fletches where there are pegs,’ afig for the doctor, for there’s no need of him to cure this ailment.Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures instrange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am thegreater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but Idid not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come topass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the callingof chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.”“Peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “thou seest my suspension andretirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honouredcalling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a countyto bestow on thee.”“May God hear it and sin be deaf,” said Sancho; “I have always heardsay that ‘a good hope is better than a bad holding.”As they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased andexclaiming, “Reward me for my good news, Señor Don Quixote! DonGregorio and the renegade who went for him have come ashore—ashore do Isay? They are by this time in the viceroy’s house, and will be hereimmediately.”Don Quixote cheered up a little and said, “Of a truth I am almost readyto say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way,for it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by themight of my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only DonGregorio, but all the Christian captives there are in Barbary. But whatam I saying, miserable being that I am? Am I not he that has beenconquered? Am I not he that has been overthrown? Am I not he who mustnot take up arms for a year? Then what am I making professions for;what am I bragging about; when it is fitter for me to handle thedistaff than the sword?”“No more of that, señor,” said Sancho; “‘let the hen live, even thoughit be with her pip;’ ‘to-day for thee and to-morrow for me;’ in theseaffairs of encounters and whacks one must not mind them, for he thatfalls to-day may get up to-morrow; unless indeed he chooses to lie inbed, I mean gives way to weakness and does not pluck up fresh spiritfor fresh battles; let your worship get up now to receive Don Gregorio;for the household seems to be in a bustle, and no doubt he has come bythis time;” and so it proved, for as soon as Don Gregorio and therenegade had given the viceroy an account of the voyage out and home,Don Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with the renegade to DonAntonio’s house. When they carried him away from Algiers he was inwoman’s dress; on board the vessel, however, he exchanged it for thatof a captive who escaped with him; but in whatever dress he might be helooked like one to be loved and served and esteemed, for he wassurpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances some seventeenor eighteen years of age. Ricote and his daughter came out to welcomehim, the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. They did notembrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never beovermuch boldness. Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorioand the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who werepresent. It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, andtheir eyes were the tongues that declared their pure and happyfeelings. The renegade explained the measures and means he had adoptedto rescue Don Gregorio, and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in afew words, in which he showed that his intelligence was in advance ofhis years, described the peril and embarrassment he found himself inamong the women with whom he had sojourned. To conclude, Ricoteliberally recompensed and rewarded as well the renegade as the men whohad rowed; and the renegade effected his readmission into the body ofthe Church and was reconciled with it, and from a rotten limb became bypenance and repentance a clean and sound one.Two days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps theyshould take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for itseemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was sogood a Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposedremaining there. Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at thecapital, whither he was compelled to go on some other business, hintingthat many a difficult affair was settled there with the help of favourand bribes.“Nay,” said Ricote, who was present during the conversation, “it willnot do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the great DonBernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty hasentrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes norappeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he minglesmercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation istainted and corrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns ratherthan the salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care andthe fear he inspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weightof this great policy and carried it into effect, all our schemes andplots, importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Arguseyes, ever on the watch lest one of us should remain behind inconcealment, and like a hidden root come in course of time to sproutand bear poisonous fruit in Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of thefear in which our vast numbers kept it. Heroic resolve of the greatPhilip the Third, and unparalleled wisdom to have entrusted it to thesaid Don Bernardino de Velasco!”“At any rate,” said Don Antonio, “when I am there I will make allpossible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don Gregoriowill come with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents must besuffering on account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my housewith my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be gladthat the worthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms Ican make.”The viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio onlearning what had passed declared he could not and would not on anyaccount leave Ana Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and seehis parents and devise some way of returning for her, he fell in withthe proposed arrangement. Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio’s wife,and Ricote in the viceroy’s house.The day for Don Antonio’s departure came; and two days later that forDon Quixote’s and Sancho’s, for Don Quixote’s fall did not suffer himto take the road sooner. There were tears and sighs, swoonings andsobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix. Ricote offeredDon Gregorio a thousand crowns if he would have them, but he would nottake any save five which Don Antonio lent him and he promised to repayat the capital. So the two of them took their departure, and DonQuixote and Sancho afterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixotewithout his armour and in travelling gear, and Sancho on foot, Dapplebeing loaded with the armour.p65e.jpg (43K)CHAPTER LXVI.WHICH TREATS OF WHAT HE WHO READS WILL SEE, OR WHAT HE WHO HAS IT READTO HIM WILL HEARp66a.jpg (125K)Full SizeAs he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where hehad fallen. “Here Troy was,” said he; “here my ill-luck, not mycowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made methe victim of her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements wasdimmed; here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.”p66b.jpg (251K)Full Size“Señor,” said Sancho on hearing this, “it is the part of brave heartsto be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; Ijudge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad, now that Iam a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that shewhom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, whatis more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knowswhom she casts down or whom she sets up.”“Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “thouspeakest very sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I can tell theethere is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does anything whichtakes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by thespecial preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that ‘eachof us is the maker of his own Fortune.’ I have been that of mine; butnot with the proper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence hastherefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have reflected thatRocinante’s feeble strength could not resist the mighty bulk of theKnight of the White Moon’s horse. In a word, I ventured it, I did mybest, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour I did not lose norcan I lose the virtue of keeping my word. When I was a knight-errant,daring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and deed, andnow that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping thepromise I have given. Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to keepthe year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion weshall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgottencalling of arms.”“Señor,” returned Sancho, “travelling on foot is not such a pleasantthing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make long marches.Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of someone thathas been hanged; and then with me on Dapple’s back and my feet off theground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measurethem out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and makelong ones, is to suppose nonsense.”“Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “let my armour be hung upfor a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees whatwas inscribed on the trophy of Roland’s armour-These let none moveWho dareth not his might with Roland prove.”“That’s the very thing,” said Sancho; “and if it was not that we shouldfeel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leavehim hung up too.”“And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,” saidDon Quixote, “that it may not be said, ‘for good service a badreturn.’”“Your worship is right,” said Sancho; “for, as sensible people hold,‘the fault of the ass must not be laid on the pack-saddle;’ and, as inthis affair the fault is your worship’s, punish yourself and don’t letyour anger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, orthe meekness of Rocinante, or the tenderness of my feet, trying to makethem travel more than is reasonable.”p66c.jpg (389K)Full SizeIn converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the foursucceeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number ofpeople at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.Upon Don Quixote’s approach a peasant called out, “One of these twogentlemen who come here, and who don’t know the parties, will tell uswhat we ought to do about our wager.”“That I will, certainly,” said Don Quixote, “and according to therights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.”“Well, here it is, worthy sir,” said the peasant; “a man of thisvillage who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, aneighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. Theagreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces withequal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights wereto be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone,should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twentystone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.”“Not at all,” exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote couldanswer; “it’s for me, that only a few days ago left off being agovernor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtfulquestions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.”“Answer in God’s name, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “for I amnot fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.”With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clusteredround him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his,“Brothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it ashadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that thechallenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choosesuch as will prevent and keep him from winning. My decision, therefore,is that the fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself,and take eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as hepleases, and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to ninestone weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone ofhis opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms.”“By all that’s good,” said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho’sdecision, “but the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and givenjudgment like a canon! But I’ll be bound the fat man won’t part with anounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.”“The best plan will be for them not to run,” said another, “so thatneither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one striphimself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let’stake these gentlemen to the tavern where there’s the best, and ‘over mebe the cloak when it rains.’”“I thank you, sirs,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot stop for aninstant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seemdiscourteous and to travel apace;” and spurring Rocinante he pushed on,leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his ownstrange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they tookSancho to be; and another of them observed, “If the servant is soclever, what must the master be? I’ll bet, if they are going toSalamanca to study, they’ll come to be alcaldes of the Court in atrice; for it’s a mere joke—only to read and read, and have interestand good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds himself witha staff in his hand or a mitre on his head.”That night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, andthe next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw comingtowards them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin orspiked staff in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soonas he came close to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half runningcame up to him, and embracing his right thigh, for he could reach nohigher, exclaimed with evident pleasure, “O Señor Don Quixote of LaMancha, what happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke whenhe knows your worship is coming back to his castle, for he is stillthere with my lady the duchess!”“I do not recognise you, friend,” said Don Quixote, “nor do I know whoyou are, unless you tell me.”“I am Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, Señor Don Quixote,” repliedthe courier; “he who refused to fight your worship about marrying thedaughter of Doña Rodriguez.”“God bless me!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “is it possible that you are theone whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the lacquey you speakof in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?”“Nonsense, good sir!” said the messenger; “there was no enchantment ortransformation at all; I entered the lists just as much lacquey Tosilosas I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry withoutfighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a verydifferent result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle mylord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for havingacted contrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the combat;and the end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, andDoña Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way toBarcelona with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master issending him. If your worship would like a drop, sound though warm, Ihave a gourd here full of the best, and some scraps of Tronchon cheesethat will serve as a provocative and wakener of your thirst if so be itis asleep.”“I take the offer,” said Sancho; “no more compliments about it; pourout, good Tosilos, in spite of all the enchanters in the Indies.”“Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,” said DonQuixote, “and the greatest booby on earth, not to be able to see thatthis courier is enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop with himand take thy fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come upwith me.”The lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, andtaking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on thegreen grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contentsof the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked thewrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.Said Tosilos to Sancho, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this masterof thine ought to be a madman.”“Ought!” said Sancho; “he owes no man anything; he pays for everything,particularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain enough, and Itell him so plain enough; but what’s the use? especially now that it isall over with him, for here he is beaten by the Knight of the WhiteMoon.”Tosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho repliedthat it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him;and that some other day if they met there would be time enough forthat; and then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing thecrumbs out of his beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and biddingadieu to Tosilos left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting forhim under the shade of a tree.p66e.jpg (29K)CHAPTER LXVII.OF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO ALIFE IN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD WASRUNNING ITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPYp67a.jpg (145K)Full SizeIf a multitude of reflections used to harass Don Quixote before he hadbeen overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. He wasunder the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies onhoney, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. Some of themturned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he wasabout to lead in his enforced retirement. Sancho came up and spoke inhigh praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos.“Is it possible, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thou dost still thinkthat he yonder is a real lacquey? Apparently it has escaped thy memorythat thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasantwench, and the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelor Carrasco; allthe work of the enchanters that persecute me. But tell me now, didstthou ask this Tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become ofAltisidora, did she weep over my absence, or has she already consignedto oblivion the love thoughts that used to afflict her when I waspresent?”“The thoughts that I had,” said Sancho, “were not such as to leave timefor asking fool’s questions. Body o’ me, señor! is your worship in acondition now to inquire into other people’s thoughts, above all lovethoughts?”“Look ye, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there is a great differencebetween what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude. Aknight may very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible,strictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to allappearance, loved me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thouknowest of; she wept at my departure, she cursed me, she abused me,casting shame to the winds she bewailed herself in public; all signsthat she adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses. Ihad no hopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine aregiven to Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like thoseof the fairies,’ illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is theplace in my memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to thatwhich I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thyremissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh—would that Isaw it eaten by wolves—which would rather keep itself for the wormsthan for the relief of that poor lady.”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “if the truth is to be told, I cannot persuademyself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with thedisenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, ‘If your head achesrub ointment on your knees;’ at any rate I’ll make bold to swear thatin all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship hasread you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; butwhether or no I’ll whip myself when I have a fancy for it, and theopportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.”“God grant it,” said Don Quixote; “and heaven give thee grace to takeit to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, whois thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.”As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the verysame spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don Quixoterecognised it, and said he to Sancho, “This is the meadow where we cameupon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying torevive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as itwas happy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it,Sancho, I would have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the timeI have to live in retirement. I will buy some ewes and everything elserequisite for the pastoral calling; and, I under the name of theshepherd Quixotize and thou as the shepherd Panzino, we will roam thewoods and groves and meadows singing songs here, lamenting in elegiesthere, drinking of the crystal waters of the springs or limpid brooksor flowing rivers. The oaks will yield us their sweet fruit withbountiful hand, the trunks of the hard cork trees a seat, the willowsshade, the roses perfume, the widespread meadows carpets tinted with athousand dyes; the clear pure air will give us breath, the moon andstars lighten the darkness of the night for us, song shall be ourdelight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will supply us with verses, and lovewith conceits whereby we shall make ourselves famed for ever, not onlyin this but in ages to come.”“Egad,” said Sancho, “but that sort of life squares, nay corners, withmy notions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrasco and MasterNicholas the barber won’t have well seen it before they’ll want tofollow it and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it may notcome into the curate’s head to join the sheepfold too, he’s so jovialand fond of enjoying himself.”“Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “and thebachelor Samson Carrasco, if he enters the pastoral fraternity, as nodoubt he will, may call himself the shepherd Samsonino, or perhaps theshepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself Niculoso, asold Boscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the curate I don’t knowwhat name we can fit to him unless it be something derived from histitle, and we call him the shepherd Curiambro. For the shepherdesseswhose lovers we shall be, we can pick names as we would pears; and asmy lady’s name does just as well for a shepherdess’s as for aprincess’s, I need not trouble myself to look for one that will suither better; to thine, Sancho, thou canst give what name thou wilt.”“I don’t mean to give her any but Teresona,” said Sancho, “which willgo well with her stoutness and with her own right name, as she iscalled Teresa; and then when I sing her praises in my verses I’ll showhow chaste my passion is, for I’m not going to look ‘for better breadthan ever came from wheat’ in other men’s houses. It won’t do for thecurate to have a shepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if thebachelor chooses to have one, that is his look-out.”“God bless me, Sancho my friend!” said Don Quixote, “what a life weshall lead! What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes we shall hear, whattabors, timbrels, and rebecks! And then if among all these differentsorts of music that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoralinstruments will be there.”“What are albogues?” asked Sancho, “for I never in my life heard tellof them or saw them.”“Albogues,” said Don Quixote, “are brass plates like candlesticks thatstruck against one another on the hollow side make a noise which, ifnot very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords verywell with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor. The word albogue isMorisco, as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with _al;_for example, _almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema,almacen, alcancia_, and others of the same sort, of which there are notmany more; our language has only three that are Morisco and end in _i_,which are _borceguí, zaquizamí_, and _maravedí. Alhelí_ and _alfaquí_are seen to be Arabic, as well by the _al_ at the beginning as by the_í_ they end with. I mention this incidentally, the chance allusion toalbogues having reminded me of it; and it will be of great assistanceto us in the perfect practice of this calling that I am something of apoet, as thou knowest, and that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco isan accomplished one. Of the curate I say nothing; but I will wager hehas some spice of the poet in him, and no doubt Master Nicholas too,for all barbers, or most of them, are guitar players and stringers ofverses. I will bewail my separation; thou shalt glorify thyself as aconstant lover; the shepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejected one,and the curate Curiambro as whatever may please him best; and so allwill go as gaily as heart could wish.”To this Sancho made answer, “I am so unlucky, señor, that I’m afraidthe day will never come when I’ll see myself at such a calling. O whatneat spoons I’ll make when I’m a shepherd! What messes, creams,garlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don’t get me a name forwisdom, they’ll not fail to get me one for ingenuity. My daughterSanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture. But stay—she’sgood-looking, and shepherds there are with more mischief thansimplicity in them; I would not have her ‘come for wool and go backshorn;’ love-making and lawless desires are just as common in thefields as in the cities, and in shepherds’ shanties as in royalpalaces; ‘do away with the cause, you do away with the sin;’ ‘if eyesdon’t see hearts don’t break’ and ‘better a clear escape than goodmen’s prayers.’”“A truce to thy proverbs, Sancho,” exclaimed Don Quixote; “any one ofthose thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning; many atime have I recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and toexercise some moderation in delivering them; but it seems to me it isonly ‘preaching in the desert;’ ‘my mother beats me and I go on with mytricks.”“It seems to me,” said Sancho, “that your worship is like the commonsaying, ‘Said the frying-pan to the kettle, Get away, blackbreech.’ Youchide me for uttering proverbs, and you string them in couplesyourself.”“Observe, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “I bring in proverbs to thepurpose, and when I quote them they fit like a ring to the finger; thoubringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a way that thoudost drag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am not mistaken, Ihave told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn from theexperience and observation of our wise men of old; but the proverb thatis not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim. Butenough of this; as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some littledistance from the high road to pass the night; what is in store for usto-morrow God knoweth.”They turned aside, and supped late and poorly, very much againstSancho’s will, who turned over in his mind the hardships attendant uponknight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plentypresented itself in castles and houses, as at Don Diego de Miranda’s,at the wedding of Camacho the Rich, and at Don Antonio Moreno’s; hereflected, however, that it could not be always day, nor always night;and so that night he passed in sleeping, and his master in waking.p67e.jpg (55K)CHAPTER LXVIII.OF THE BRISTLY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTEp68a.jpg (119K)Full SizeThe night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky itwas not in a quarter where she could be seen; for sometimes the ladyDiana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains allblack and the valleys in darkness. Don Quixote obeyed nature so far asto sleep his first sleep, but did not give way to the second, verydifferent from Sancho, who never had any second, because with him sleeplasted from night till morning, wherein he showed what a soundconstitution and few cares he had. Don Quixote’s cares kept himrestless, so much so that he awoke Sancho and said to him, “I amamazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of thy temperament. I believe thou artmade of marble or hard brass, incapable of any emotion or feelingwhatever. I lie awake while thou sleepest, I weep while thou singest, Iam faint with fasting while thou art sluggish and torpid from purerepletion. It is the duty of good servants to share the sufferings andfeel the sorrows of their masters, if it be only for the sake ofappearances. See the calmness of the night, the solitude of the spot,inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of some sort. Rise as thoulivest, and retire a little distance, and with a good heart andcheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes on accountof Dulcinea’s disenchantment score; and this I entreat of thee, makingit a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with thee a secondtime, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laid themon we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thouthy constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we areto follow at our village.”“Señor,” replied Sancho, “I’m no monk to get up out of the middle of mysleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass fromone extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. Will yourworship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or you’llmake me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say myflesh.”“O hard heart!” said Don Quixote, “O pitiless squire! O breadill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have done theeand those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen thyself agovernor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation ofbeing a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for I—_posttenebras spero lucem_.”“I don’t know what that is,” said Sancho; “all I know is that so longas I am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, trouble nor glory; andgood luck betide him that invented sleep, the cloak that covers overall a man’s thoughts, the food that removes hunger, the drink thatdrives away thirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold that tempersthe heat, and, to wind up with, the universal coin wherewith everythingis bought, the weight and balance that makes the shepherd equal withthe king and the fool with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, hasonly one fault, that it is like death; for between a sleeping man and adead man there is very little difference.”“Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,” said DonQuixote; “and here I begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dostsometimes quote, ‘Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou artfed.’”“Ha, by my life, master mine,” said Sancho, “it’s not I that amstringing proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your worship’smouth faster than from mine; only there is this difference between mineand yours, that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely; but anyhow,they are all proverbs.”At this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemedto spread through all the valleys around. Don Quixote stood up and laidhis hand upon his sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple andput the bundle of armour on one side of him and the ass’s pack-saddleon the other, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote’sperturbation. Each instant the noise increased and came nearer to thetwo terrified men, or at least to one, for as to the other, his courageis known to all. The fact of the matter was that some men were takingabove six hundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way withthem at that hour, and so great was the noise they made and theirgrunting and blowing, that they deafened the ears of Don Quixote andSancho Panza, and they could not make out what it was. The wide-spreadgrunting drove came on in a surging mass, and without showing anyrespect for Don Quixote’s dignity or Sancho’s, passed right over thepair of them, demolishing Sancho’s entrenchments, and not onlyupsetting Don Quixote but sweeping Rocinante off his feet into thebargain; and what with the trampling and the grunting, and the pace atwhich the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle, armour, Dapple andRocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sancho and Don Quixoteat their wits’ end.Sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him hissword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerlypigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.“Let them be, my friend,” said Don Quixote; “this insult is the penaltyof my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackalsshould devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him and pigs tramplehim under foot.”“I suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,” said Sancho, “thatflies should prick the squires of vanquished knights, and lice eatthem, and hunger assail them. If we squires were the sons of theknights we serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonderif the penalty of their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourthgeneration. But what have the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? Well,well, let’s lie down again and sleep out what little of the nightthere’s left, and God will send us dawn and we shall be all right.”p68b.jpg (345K)Full Size“Sleep thou, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “for thou wast born tosleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it now wants of dawnI will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in alittle madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head lastnight.”“I should think,” said Sancho, “that the thoughts that allow one tomake verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship stringverses as much as you like and I’ll sleep as much as I can;” andforthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he muffled himselfup and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or troubleof any sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or acork tree—for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree itwas—sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs:When in my mindI muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,To death I flee,In hope therein the end of all to find.But drawing nearThat welcome haven in my sea of woe,Such joy I know,That life revives, and still I linger here.Thus life doth slay,And death again to life restoreth me;Strange destiny,That deals with life and death as with a play!He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, justlike one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and hisseparation from Dulcinea.And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with hisbeams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched hislazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores hecursed the drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed theirjourney, and as evening closed in they saw coming towards them some tenmen on horseback and four or five on foot. Don Quixote’s heart beatquick and Sancho’s quailed with fear, for the persons approaching themcarried lances and bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. DonQuixote turned to Sancho and said, “If I could make use of my weapons,and my promise had not tied my hands, I would count this host thatcomes against us but cakes and fancy bread; but perhaps it may provesomething different from what we apprehend.” The men on horseback nowcame up, and raising their lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence,and pointed them at his back and breast, menacing him with death. Oneof those on foot, putting his finger to his lips as a sign to him to besilent, seized Rocinante’s bridle and drew him out of the road, and theothers driving Sancho and Dapple before them, and all maintaining astrange silence, followed in the steps of the one who led Don Quixote.The latter two or three times attempted to ask where they were takinghim to and what they wanted, but the instant he began to open his lipsthey threatened to close them with the points of their lances; andSancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed about to speak oneof those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple likewise, as if hetoo wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their pace, and thefears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heardthemselves assailed with—“Get on, ye Troglodytes;” “Silence, yebarbarians;” “March, ye cannibals;” “No murmuring, ye Scythians;”“Don’t open your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirstylions,” and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the earsof the wretched master and man. Sancho went along saying to himself,“We, tortolites, barbers, animals! I don’t like those names at all;‘it’s in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;’ ‘misfortune comes uponus all at once like sticks on a dog,’ and God grant it may be no worsethan them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.”Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his witsto make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names theycalled them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that therewas no good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, aboutan hour after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw atonce was the duke’s, where they had been but a short time before. “Godbless me!” said he, as he recognised the mansion, “what does this mean?It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with thevanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.”They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared andfitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled theirfears, as will be seen in the following chapter.p68e.jpg (49K)CHAPTER LXIX.OF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DONQUIXOTE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT HISTORYp69a.jpg (141K)Full SizeThe horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without amoment’s delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carriedthem into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed insockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in thecorridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, thewant of daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court wasa catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and coveredcompletely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps allround it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silvercandlesticks. Upon the catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel solovely that by her beauty she made death itself look beautiful. She laywith her head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with agarland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossedupon her bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory. Onone side of the court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs wereseated two persons who from having crowns on their heads and sceptresin their hands appeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mockones. By the side of this stage, which was reached by steps, were twoother chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners seated Don Quixoteand Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them to understand thatthey too were to be silent; which, however, they would have beenwithout any signs, for their amazement at all they saw held themtongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction, who were at oncerecognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and duchess, ascendedthe stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on twogorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be. Who wouldnot have been amazed at this? Nor was this all, for Don Quixote hadperceived that the dead body on the catafalque was that of the fairAltisidora. As the duke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote andSancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which they returned bybowing their heads slightly. At this moment an official crossed over,and approaching Sancho threw over him a robe of black buckram paintedall over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put upon his heada mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear;and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or they wouldput a gag upon him, or take his life. Sancho surveyed himself from headto foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did notburn him, he did not care two farthings for them. He took off the mitreand seeing it painted with devils he put it on again, saying tohimself, “Well, so far those don’t burn me nor do these carry me off.”Don Quixote surveyed him too, and though fear had got the better of hisfaculties, he could not help smiling to see the figure Sanchopresented. And now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, thererose a low sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice(for there silence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishingeffect. Then, beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body,suddenly appeared a fair youth in a Roman habit, who, to theaccompaniment of a harp which he himself played, sang in a sweet andclear voice these two stanzas:While fair Altisidora, who the sport    Of cold Don Quixote’s cruelty hath been,Returns to life, and in this magic court    The dames in sables come to grace the scene,And while her matrons all in seemly sort    My lady robes in baize and bombazine,Her beauty and her sorrows will I singWith defter quill than touched the Thracian string.But not in life alone, methinks, to me    Belongs the office; Lady, when my tongueIs cold in death, believe me, unto thee    My voice shall raise its tributary song.My soul, from this strait prison-house set free,    As o’er the Stygian lake it floats along,Thy praises singing still shall hold its way,And make the waters of oblivion stay.At this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, “Enough,enough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us nowthe death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as theignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in thepenance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore herto the long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittestin judgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest allthat the inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation ofthis damsel, announce and declare it at once, that the happiness welook forward to from her restoration be no longer deferred.”No sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, thanRhadamanthus rising up said:“Ho, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, make hastehither one and all, and print on Sancho’s face four-and-twenty smacks,and give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms;for upon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.”On hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out, “By all that’sgood, I’ll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Bodyo’ me! What has handling my face got to do with the resurrection ofthis damsel? ‘The old woman took kindly to the blits;’ they enchantDulcinea, and whip me in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies ofailments God was pleased to send her, and to bring her to life againthey must give me four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my bodywith pins, and raise weals on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes ona brother-in-law; ‘I’m an old dog, and “tus, tus” is no use with me.’”“Thou shalt die,” said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; “relent, thoutiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and he silent, for noimpossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire intothe difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thoushalt see thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, Isay, officials, obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, yeshall see what ye were born for.”At this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made theirappearance in procession, one after the other, four of them withspectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing fourfingers of wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashionnow-a-days. No sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowinglike a bull, he exclaimed, “I might let myself be handled by all theworld; but allow duennas to touch me—not a bit of it! Scratch my face,as my master was served in this very castle; run me through the bodywith burnished daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I’ll bearall in patience to serve these gentlefolk; but I won’t let duennastouch me, though the devil should carry me off!”Here Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, “Have patience,my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to heaventhat it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its sufferingsthou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead.”The duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having become moretractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presentedhis face and beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutlylaid on, and then made him a low curtsey.“Less politeness and less paint, señora duenna,” said Sancho; “by Godyour hands smell of vinegar-wash.”In line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of thehousehold pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked bythe pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of hischair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon theduennas and the whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, “Begone, yeministers of hell; I’m not made of brass not to feel suchout-of-the-way tortures.”At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been solong lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanderscried out almost with one voice, “Altisidora is alive! Altisidoralives!”Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had inview was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went onhis knees to Sancho saying to him, “Now is the time, son of my bowels,not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of thoselashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.Now, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, andendowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.”To which Sancho made answer, “That’s trick upon trick, I think, and nothoney upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to comenow, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! You had bettertake a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; Ishould not mind it much, if I’m to be always made the cow of thewedding for the cure of other people’s ailments. Leave me alone; orelse by God I’ll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may.”Altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did sothe clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of allpresent exclaiming, “Long life to Altisidora! long life to Altisidora!”The duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus stood up, andall, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to receive her andtake her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she wererecovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and tothe kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him, “Godforgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been,to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and tothee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life Iam now in possession of. From this day forth, friend Sancho, count asthine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as manyshirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at any ratethey are all clean.”Sancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre inhis hand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back hiscap and doublet and remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke tolet them leave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them homefor a token and memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess saidthey must leave them with him; for he knew already what a great friendof his she was. The duke then gave orders that the court should becleared, and that all should retire to their chambers, and that DonQuixote and Sancho should be conducted to their old quarters.p69e.jpg (60K)CHAPTER LXX.WHICH FOLLOWS SIXTY-NINE AND DEALS WITH MATTERS INDISPENSABLE FOR THECLEAR COMPREHENSION OF THIS HISTORYp70a.jpg (131K)Full SizeSancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with Don Quixote,a thing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very wellthat with questions and answers his master would not let him sleep, andhe was in no humour for talking much, as he still felt the pain of hislate martyrdom, which interfered with his freedom of speech; and itwould have been more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than inthat luxurious chamber in company. And so well founded did hisapprehension prove, and so correct was his anticipation, that scarcelyhad his master got into bed when he said, “What dost thou think ofto-night’s adventure, Sancho? Great and mighty is the power ofcold-hearted scorn, for thou with thine own eyes hast seen Altisidoraslain, not by arrows, nor by the sword, nor by any warlike weapon, norby deadly poisons, but by the thought of the sternness and scorn withwhich I have always treated her.”“She might have died and welcome,” said Sancho, “when she pleased andhow she pleased; and she might have left me alone, for I never made herfall in love or scorned her. I don’t know nor can I imagine how therecovery of Altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise, can have, asI have said before, anything to do with the sufferings of Sancho Panza.Now I begin to see plainly and clearly that there are enchanters andenchanted people in the world; and may God deliver me from them, sinceI can’t deliver myself; and so I beg of your worship to let me sleepand not ask me any more questions, unless you want me to throw myselfout of the window.”“Sleep, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “if the pinprodding andpinches thou hast received and the smacks administered to thee will letthee.”“No pain came up to the insult of the smacks,” said Sancho, “for thesimple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gave them to me;but once more I entreat your worship to let me sleep, for sleep isrelief from misery to those who are miserable when awake.”“Be it so, and God be with thee,” said Don Quixote.They fell asleep, both of them, and Cide Hamete, the author of thisgreat history, took this opportunity to record and relate what it wasthat induced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that hasbeen described. The bachelor Samson Carrasco, he says, not forgettinghow he as the Knight of the Mirrors had been vanquished and overthrownby Don Quixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans,resolved to try his hand again, hoping for better luck than he hadbefore; and so, having learned where Don Quixote was from the page whobrought the letter and present to Sancho’s wife, Teresa Panza, he gothimself new armour and another horse, and put a white moon upon hisshield, and to carry his arms he had a mule led by a peasant, not byTom Cecial his former squire for fear he should be recognised by Sanchoor Don Quixote. He came to the duke’s castle, and the duke informed himof the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of beingpresent at the jousts at Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes hehad practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment ofDulcinea at the expense of Sancho’s backside; and finally he gave himan account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making himbelieve that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench;and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was hehimself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; atwhich the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at thesharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which DonQuixote’s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whetherhe overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result.This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and notfinding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been alreadytold. He returned to the duke’s castle and told him all, what theconditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like aloyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to hisvillage for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhapsbe cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him toadopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of suchgood parts as Don Quixote to be a madman. And so he took his leave ofthe duke, and went home to his village to wait there for Don Quixote,who was coming after him. Thereupon the duke seized the opportunity ofpractising this mystification upon him; so much did he enjoy everythingconnected with Sancho and Don Quixote. He had the roads about thecastle far and near, everywhere he thought Don Quixote was likely topass on his return, occupied by large numbers of his servants on footand on horseback, who were to bring him to the castle, by fair means orfoul, if they met him. They did meet him, and sent word to the duke,who, having already settled what was to be done, as soon as he heard ofhis arrival, ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be lit andAltisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp andceremony that has been described, the whole affair being so wellarranged and acted that it differed but little from reality. And CideHamete says, moreover, that for his part he considers the concocters ofthe joke as crazy as the victims of it, and that the duke and duchesswere not two fingers’ breadth removed from being something like foolsthemselves when they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools.As for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awakeoccupied with his desultory thoughts, when daylight came to thembringing with it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never adelight to Don Quixote, victor or vanquished. Altisidora, come backfrom death to life as Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak ofher lord and lady, entered the chamber, crowned with the garland shehad worn on the catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroideredwith gold flowers, her hair flowing loose over her shoulders, andleaning upon a staff of fine black ebony. Don Quixote, disconcerted andin confusion at her appearance, huddled himself up and well-nighcovered himself altogether with the sheets and counterpane of the bed,tongue-tied, and unable to offer her any civility. Altisidora seatedherself on a chair at the head of the bed, and, after a deep sigh, saidto him in a feeble, soft voice, “When women of rank and modest maidenstrample honour under foot, and give a loose to the tongue that breaksthrough every impediment, publishing abroad the inmost secrets of theirhearts, they are reduced to sore extremities. Such a one am I, SeñorDon Quixote of La Mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten, but yetpatient under suffering and virtuous, and so much so that my heartbroke with grief and I lost my life. For the last two days I have beendead, slain by the thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treatedme, obdurate knight,O harder thou than marble to my plaint;or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not beenthat Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferingsof this good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.”“Love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass,and I should have been obliged to him,” said Sancho. “But tell me,señora—and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master—what didyou see in the other world? What goes on in hell? For of course that’swhere one who dies in despair is bound for.”“To tell you the truth,” said Altisidora, “I cannot have died outright,for I did not go into hell; had I gone in, it is very certain I shouldnever have come out again, do what I might. The truth is, I came to thegate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis, all inbreeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemishbonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, withfour fingers’ breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands looklonger; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed mestill more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, servedthem for tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however,did not astonish me so much as to observe that, although with playersit is usual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there inthat game all were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursingone another.” “That’s no wonder,” said Sancho; “for devils, whetherplaying or not, can never be content, win or lose.”“Very likely,” said Altisidora; “but there is another thing thatsurprises me too, I mean surprised me then, and that was that no balloutlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it waswonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. Toone of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke thatthey knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. ‘Lookwhat book that is,’ said one devil to another, and the other replied,‘It is the “Second Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,”not by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by an Aragonese who by hisown account is of Tordesillas.’ ‘Out of this with it,’ said the first,‘and into the depths of hell with it out of my sight.’ ‘Is it so bad?’said the other. ‘So bad is it,’ said the first, ‘that if I had setmyself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.’ Theythen went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I, havingheard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adore so,took care to retain this vision in my memory.”“A vision it must have been, no doubt,” said Don Quixote, “for there isno other I in the world; this history has been going about here forsome time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, foreverybody gives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed by hearingthat I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit orin the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of. Ifit should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; butif it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a verylong journey.”Altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote,when he said to her, “I have several times told you, señora, that itgrieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from minethey can only receive gratitude, but no return. I was born to belong toDulcinea del Toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me toher; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place sheoccupies in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. This frankdeclaration should suffice to make you retire within the bounds of yourmodesty, for no one can bind himself to do impossibilities.”Hearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation,exclaimed, “God’s life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of adate, more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when hehas his mind made up, if I fall upon you I’ll tear your eyes out! Doyou fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake?All that you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I’m not thewoman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much lessdie!”“That I can well believe,” said Sancho; “for all that about loverspining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doingit—Judas may believe that!”While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sungthe two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance toDon Quixote said, “Will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain mein the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been agreat admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of yourachievements?” “Will your worship tell me who you are,” replied DonQuixote, “so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?” Theyoung man replied that he was the musician and songster of the nightbefore. “Of a truth,” said Don Quixote, “your worship has a mostexcellent voice; but what you sang did not seem to me very much to thepurpose; for what have Garcilasso’s stanzas to do with the death ofthis lady?”“Don’t be surprised at that,” returned the musician; “for with thecallow poets of our day the way is for every one to write as he pleasesand pilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane to the matter ornot, and now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can sing orwrite that is not set down to poetic licence.”Don Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke andduchess, who came in to see him, and with them there followed a longand delightful conversation, in the course of which Sancho said so manydroll and saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering notonly at his simplicity but at his sharpness. Don Quixote begged theirpermission to take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for avanquished knight like himself it was fitter he should live in apig-sty than in a royal palace. They gave it very readily, and theduchess asked him if Altisidora was in his good graces.He replied, “Señora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel’sailment comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest andconstant employment. She herself has told me that lace is worn in hell;and as she must know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands;for when she is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the imageor images of what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts;this is the truth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.”“And mine,” added Sancho; “for I never in all my life saw a lace-makerthat died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more seton finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. I speak frommy own experience; for when I’m digging I never think of my old woman;I mean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my own eyelids.” “Yousay well, Sancho,” said the duchess, “and I will take care that myAltisidora employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; forshe is extremely expert at it.” “There is no occasion to have recourseto that remedy, señora,” said Altisidora; “for the mere thought of thecruelty with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice toblot him out of my memory without any other device; with yourhighness’s leave I will retire, not to have before my eyes, I won’t sayhis rueful countenance, but his abominable, ugly looks.” “That remindsme of the common saying, that ‘he that rails is ready to forgive,’”said the duke.Altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.“Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,” said Sancho, “ill luck betidethee! Thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart ashard as oak; had it been me, i’faith ‘another cock would have crowed tothee.’”So the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote dressed himself anddined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.p70e.jpg (73K)Full SizeCHAPTER LXXI.OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE SANCHO ON THE WAY TOTHEIR VILLAGEp71a.jpg (82K)Full SizeThe vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast inone respect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from hisdefeat, and his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay inSancho, as had been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though itwas with difficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smittendamsel had been really dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful,for it grieved him that Altisidora had not kept her promise of givinghim the smocks; and turning this over in his mind he said to hismaster, “Surely, señor, I’m the most unlucky doctor in the world;there’s many a physician that, after killing the sick man he had tocure, requires to be paid for his work, though it is only signing a bitof a list of medicines, that the apothecary and not he makes up, and,there, his labour is over; but with me though to cure somebody elsecosts me drops of blood, smacks, pinches, pinproddings, and whippings,nobody gives me a farthing. Well, I swear by all that’s good if theyput another patient into my hands, they’ll have to grease them for mebefore I cure him; for, as they say, ‘it’s by his singing the abbotgets his dinner,’ and I’m not going to believe that heaven has bestowedupon me the virtue I have, that I should be dealing it out to othersall for nothing.”“Thou art right, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “and Altisidorahas behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised; andalthough that virtue of thine is _gratis data_—as it has cost thee nostudy whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings maybe—I can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for thelashes on account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I would have given itto thee freely ere this. I am not sure, however, whether payment willcomport with the cure, and I would not have the reward interfere withthe medicine. I think there will be nothing lost by trying it; considerhow much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once, and paythyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.”At this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm’s breadthwide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, andsaid he to his master, “Very well then, señor, I’ll hold myself inreadiness to gratify your worship’s wishes if I’m to profit by it; forthe love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping. Let yourworship say how much you will pay me for each lash I give myself.”“If Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “I were to requite thee as theimportance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of Venice,the mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. See what thouhast of mine, and put a price on each lash.”“Of them,” said Sancho, “there are three thousand three hundred andodd; of these I have given myself five, the rest remain; let the fivego for the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three hundred,which at a quarter real apiece (for I will not take less though thewhole world should bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarterreals; the three thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals,which make seven hundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make ahundred and fifty half reals, which come to seventy-five reals, whichadded to the seven hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-fivereals in all. These I will stop out of what I have belonging to yourworship, and I’ll return home rich and content, though well whipped,for ‘there’s no taking trout’—but I say no more.”“O blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!” said Don Quixote; “how we shall bebound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives thatheaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot bebut that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and mydefeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thoubegin the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I willgive thee a hundred reals over and above.”“When?” said Sancho; “this night without fail. Let your worship orderit so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I’llscarify myself.”Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in theworld, came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels ofApollo’s car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself outlonger than usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make thereckoning of their desires agree with time. They made their way atlength in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance fromthe road, and there vacating Rocinante’s saddle and Dapple’spack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and madetheir supper off Sancho’s stores, and he making a powerful and flexiblewhip out of Dapple’s halter and headstall retreated about twenty pacesfrom his master among some beech trees. Don Quixote seeing him marchoff with such resolution and spirit, said to him, “Take care, myfriend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow the lashes to wait for oneanother, and do not be in so great a hurry as to run thyself out ofbreath midway; I mean, do not lay on so strenuously as to make thy lifefail thee before thou hast reached the desired number; and that thoumayest not lose by a card too much or too little, I will station myselfapart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou givest thyself. Mayheaven help thee as thy good intention deserves.”“‘Pledges don’t distress a good payer,’” said Sancho; “I mean to lay onin such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself, for in that, nodoubt, lies the essence of this miracle.”He then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up therope he began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes. He mighthave given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke notrifle, and its price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, hetold his master that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, foreach of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a realinstead of a quarter.“Go on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,” said Don Quixote;“for I double the stakes as to price.”“In that case,” said Sancho, “in God’s hand be it, and let it rainlashes.” But the rogue no longer laid them on his shoulders, but laidon to the trees, with such groans every now and then, that one wouldhave thought at each of them his soul was being plucked up by theroots. Don Quixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he might make anend of himself, and that through Sancho’s imprudence he might miss hisown object, said to him, “As thou livest, my friend, let the matterrest where it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one, and itwill be well to have patience; ‘Zamora was not won in an hour.’ If Ihave not reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over a thousand lashes;that is enough for the present; ‘for the ass,’ to put it in homelyphrase, ‘bears the load, but not the overload.’”“No, no, señor,” replied Sancho; “it shall never be said of me, ‘Themoney paid, the arms broken;’ go back a little further, your worship,and let me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more; for in acouple of bouts like this we shall have finished off the lot, and therewill be even cloth to spare.”“As thou art in such a willing mood,” said Don Quixote, “may heaven aidthee; lay on and I’ll retire.”Sancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon hadthe bark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with whichhe whipped himself; and one time, raising his voice, and giving a beecha tremendous lash, he cried out, “Here dies Samson, and all with him!”p71b.jpg (349K)Full SizeAt the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash,Don Quixote ran to him at once, and seizing the twisted halter thatserved him for a courbash, said to him, “Heaven forbid, Sancho myfriend, that to please me thou shouldst lose thy life, which is neededfor the support of thy wife and children; let Dulcinea wait for abetter opportunity, and I will content myself with a hope soon to berealised, and have patience until thou hast gained fresh strength so asto finish off this business to the satisfaction of everybody.”“As your worship will have it so, señor,” said Sancho, “so be it; butthrow your cloak over my shoulders, for I’m sweating and I don’t wantto take cold; it’s a risk that novice disciplinants run.”Don Quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered Sancho, who sleptuntil the sun woke him; they then resumed their journey, which for thetime being they brought to an end at a village that lay three leaguesfarther on. They dismounted at a hostelry which Don Quixote recognisedas such and did not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis,and drawbridge; for ever since he had been vanquished he talked morerationally about everything, as will be shown presently. They quarteredhim in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangingsthere were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use invillages. On one of them was painted by some very poor hand the Rape ofHelen, when the bold guest carried her off from Menelaus, and on theother was the story of Dido and Æneas, she on a high tower, as thoughshe were making signals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who wasout at sea flying in a frigate or brigantine. He noticed in the twostories that Helen did not go very reluctantly, for she was laughingslyly and roguishly; but the fair Dido was shown dropping tears thesize of walnuts from her eyes. Don Quixote as he looked at themobserved, “Those two ladies were very unfortunate not to have been bornin this age, and I unfortunate above all men not to have been born intheirs. Had I fallen in with those gentlemen, Troy would not have beenburned or Carthage destroyed, for it would have been only for me toslay Paris, and all these misfortunes would have been avoided.”“I’ll lay a bet,” said Sancho, “that before long there won’t be atavern, roadside inn, hostelry, or barber’s shop where the story of ourdoings won’t be painted up; but I’d like it painted by the hand of abetter painter than painted these.”“Thou art right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for this painter is likeOrbaneja, a painter there was at Úbeda, who when they asked him what hewas painting, used to say, ‘Whatever it may turn out; and if he chancedto paint a cock he would write under it, ‘This is a cock,’ for fearthey might think it was a fox. The painter or writer, for it’s all thesame, who published the history of this new Don Quixote that has comeout, must have been one of this sort I think, Sancho, for he painted orwrote ‘whatever it might turn out;’ or perhaps he is like a poet calledMauleon that was about the Court some years ago, who used to answer athaphazard whatever he was asked, and on one asking him what _Deum deDeo_ meant, he replied _Dé donde diere_. But, putting this aside, tellme, Sancho, hast thou a mind to have another turn at thyself to-night,and wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in the open air?”“Egad, señor,” said Sancho, “for what I’m going to give myself, itcomes all the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields;still I’d like it to be among trees; for I think they are company forme and help me to bear my pain wonderfully.”“And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote; “but, toenable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our own village;for at the latest we shall get there the day after to-morrow.”Sancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part hewould like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooledand while he had an appetite, because “in delay there is apt to bedanger” very often, and “praying to God and plying the hammer,” and“one take was better than two I’ll give thee’s,” and “a sparrow in thehand than a vulture on the wing.”“For God’s sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “itseems to me thou art becoming _sicut erat_ again; speak in a plain,simple, straight-forward way, as I have often told thee, and thou wiltfind the good of it.”“I don’t know what bad luck it is of mine,” said Sancho, “but I can’tutter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to mymind; however, I mean to mend if I can;” and so for the present theconversation ended.p71e.jpg (42K)CHAPTER LXXII.OF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGEp72a.jpg (155K)Full SizeAll that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and innwaiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in theopen country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay theaccomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry atraveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said tohim who appeared to be the master, “Here, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, yourworship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool.”When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, “Look here, Sancho; onturning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history Ithink I came casually upon this name of Don Álvaro Tarfe.”“Very likely,” said Sancho; “we had better let him dismount, andby-and-by we can ask about it.”The gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on theground floor opposite Don Quixote’s and adorned with painted sergehangings of the same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summercoat, and coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide andcool, addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, heasked, “In what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?”“To a village near this which is my own village,” replied Don Quixote;“and your worship, where are you bound for?”“I am going to Granada, señor,” said the gentleman, “to my owncountry.”“And a goodly country,” said Don Quixote; “but will your worship do methe favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of moreimportance to me to know it than I can tell you.”“My name is Don Álvaro Tarfe,” replied the traveller.To which Don Quixote returned, “I have no doubt whatever that yourworship is that Don Álvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the SecondPart of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed andpublished by a new author.”“I am the same,” replied the gentleman; “and that same Don Quixote, theprincipal personage in the said history, was a very great friend ofmine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least induced himto come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I wasgoing myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and saved him fromhaving his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of hisextreme rashness.”“Tell me, Señor Don Álvaro,” said Don Quixote, “am I at all like thatDon Quixote you talk of?”“No indeed,” replied the traveller, “not a bit.”“And that Don Quixote—” said our one, “had he with him a squire calledSancho Panza?”“He had,” said Don Álvaro; “but though he had the name of being verydroll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it.”“That I can well believe,” said Sancho at this, “for to come out withdrolleries is not in everybody’s line; and that Sancho your worshipspeaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, andthief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have moredrolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; comealong with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me atevery turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don’tknow what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And thereal Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, thelover, the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, theprotector of widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his solemistress the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman beforeyou, my master; all other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas aredreams and mockeries.”“By God I believe it,” said Don Álvaro; “for you have uttered moredrolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the otherSancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a few. Hewas more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I amconvinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good havebeen trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don’t knowwhat to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa delNuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a verydifferent one from mine.”“I don’t know whether I am good,” said Don Quixote, “but I can safelysay I am not ‘the Bad;’ and to prove it, let me tell you, Señor DonÁlvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been in Saragossa; so far fromthat, when it was told me that this imaginary Don Quixote had beenpresent at the jousts in that city, I declined to enter it, in order todrag his falsehood before the face of the world; and so I went onstraight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven ofstrangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of thewronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled insite and beauty. And though the adventures that befell me there are notby any means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do notregret them, simply because I have seen it. In a word, Señor Don ÁlvaroTarfe, I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, andnot the unlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deckhimself out in my ideas. I entreat your worship by your devoir as agentleman to be so good as to make a declaration before the alcalde ofthis village that you never in all your life saw me until now, and thatneither am I the Don Quixote in print in the Second Part, nor thisSancho Panza, my squire, the one your worship knew.”“That I will do most willingly,” replied Don Álvaro; “though it amazesme to find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, as muchalike in name as they differ in demeanour; and again I say and declarethat what I saw I cannot have seen, and that what happened me cannothave happened.”“No doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,”said Sancho; “and would to heaven your disenchantment rested on mygiving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what I’mgiving myself for her, for I’d lay them on without looking foranything.”“I don’t understand that about the lashes,” said Don Álvaro. Sanchoreplied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell him if theyhappened to be going the same road.By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Álvaro dinedtogether. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inntogether with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him,showing that it was requisite for his rights that Don Álvaro Tarfe, thegentleman there present, should make a declaration before him that hedid not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that hewas not the one that was in print in a history entitled “Second Part ofDon Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.” Thealcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made withall the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote andSancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of anygreat importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did notplainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the twoSanchos. Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by DonÁlvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegandisplayed such good taste that he disabused Don Álvaro of the error hewas under; and he, on his part, felt convinced he must have beenenchanted, now that he had been brought in contact with two suchopposite Don Quixotes.Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half aleague two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote’s village,the other the road Don Álvaro was to follow. In this short interval DonQuixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea’senchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Álvaro into freshamazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, andDon Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in orderto give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he didin the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark ofthe beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such goodcare that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there beenone there. The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of thecount, and he found that together with those of the night before theymade up three thousand and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got upearly to witness the sacrifice, and with his light they resumed theirjourney, discussing the deception practised on Don Álvaro, and sayinghow well done it was to have taken his declaration before a magistratein such an unimpeachable form. That day and night they travelled on,nor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that inthe course of the night Sancho finished off his task, whereat DonQuixote was beyond measure joyful. He watched for daylight, to see ifalong the road he should fall in with his already disenchanted ladyDulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there was no woman he met thathe did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he heldit absolutely certain that Merlin’s promises could not lie. Full ofthese thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a rising ground wherefromthey descried their own village, at the sight of which Sancho fell onhis knees exclaiming, “Open thine eyes, longed-for home, and see howthy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if not very rich, very wellwhipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thy son Don Quixote, who, ifhe comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes victor over himself,which, as he himself has told me, is the greatest victory anyone candesire. I’m bringing back money, for if I was well whipped, I wentmounted like a gentleman.”p72b.jpg (375K)Full Size“Have done with these fooleries,” said Don Quixote; “let us push onstraight and get to our own place, where we will give free range to ourfancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.”With this they descended the slope and directed their steps to theirvillage.p72e.jpg (35K)CHAPTER LXXIII.OF THE OMENS DON QUIXOTE HAD AS HE ENTERED HIS OWN VILLAGE, AND OTHERINCIDENTS THAT EMBELLISH AND GIVE A COLOUR TO THIS GREAT HISTORYp73a.jpg (141K)Full SizeAt the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote sawtwo boys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor, one of whom saidto the other, “Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it againas long as thou livest.”Don Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, “Dost thou not mark,friend, what that boy said, ‘Thou shalt never see it again as long asthou livest’?”“Well,” said Sancho, “what does it matter if the boy said so?”“What!” said Don Quixote, “dost thou not see that, applied to theobject of my desires, the words mean that I am never to see Dulcineamore?”Sancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing ahare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds andsportsmen. In its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself underDapple. Sancho caught it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who wassaying, “_Malum signum, malum signum!_ a hare flies, greyhounds chaseit, Dulcinea appears not.”“Your worship’s a strange man,” said Sancho; “let’s take it for grantedthat this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds chasing it themalignant enchanters who turned her into a country wench; she flies,and I catch her and put her into your worship’s hands, and you hold herin your arms and cherish her; what bad sign is that, or what ill omenis there to be found here?”The two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare,and Sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He wasanswered by the one who had said, “Thou shalt never see it again aslong as thou livest,” that he had taken a cage full of crickets fromthe other boy, and did not mean to give it back to him as long as helived. Sancho took out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them tothe boy for the cage, which he placed in Don Quixote’s hands, saying,“There, señor! there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they haveno more to do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than withlast year’s clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curateof our village say that it does not become Christians or sensiblepeople to give any heed to these silly things; and even you yourselfsaid the same to me some time ago, telling me that all Christians whominded omens were fools; but there’s no need of making words about it;let us push on and go into our village.”The sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gavethem. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the townthey came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy withtheir breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by wayof a sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, thebuckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at theduke’s castle the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixedthe mitre on Dapple’s head, the oddest transformation and decorationthat ever ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised byboth the curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms.Don Quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and theboys, who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass’s mitreand came running to see it, calling out to one another, “Come here,boys, and see Sancho Panza’s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and DonQuixote’s beast leaner than ever.”So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by thecurate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, andproceeded to Don Quixote’s house, at the door of which they found hishousekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had alreadyreached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho’s wife, as well,and she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica herdaughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing himcoming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought tobe, she said to him, “How is it you come this way, husband? It seems tome you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderlyvagabond than a governor.”“Hold your tongue, Teresa,” said Sancho; “often ‘where there are pegsthere are no flitches;’ let’s go into the house and there you’ll hearstrange things. I bring money, and that’s the main thing, got by my ownindustry without wronging anybody.”“You bring the money, my good husband,” said Teresa, “and no matterwhether it was got this way or that; for, however you may have got it,you’ll not have brought any new practice into the world.”Sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything,for she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and shetaking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand,while the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving DonQuixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in thecompany of the curate and the bachelor.Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew inprivate with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told themof his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit hisvillage for a year, which he meant to keep to the letter withoutdeparting a hair’s breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound byscrupulous good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how hethought of turning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion inthe solitude of the fields, where he could with perfect freedom giverange to his thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoralcalling; and he besought them, if they had not a great deal to do andwere not prevented by more important business, to consent to be hiscompanions, for he would buy sheep enough to qualify them forshepherds; and the most important point of the whole affair, he couldtell them, was settled, for he had given them names that would fit themto a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote replied that hehimself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the bachelor theshepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and SanchoPanza the shepherd Pancino.Both were astounded at Don Quixote’s new craze; however, lest he shouldonce more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of hischivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might becured, fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as abright one, and offered to share the life with him. “And what’s more,”said Samson Carrasco, “I am, as all the world knows, a very famouspoet, and I’ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as itmay come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regionswhere we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that eachof us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify inhis verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard,without writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit andcustom of love-smitten shepherds.”“That’s the very thing,” said Don Quixote; “though I am relieved fromlooking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there’s thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these brooksides, theornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all thegraces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, beit ever so hyperbolical.”“Very true,” said the curate; “but we the others must look about foraccommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way oranother.”“And,” added Samson Carrasco, “if they fail us, we can call them by thenames of the ones in print that the world is filled with, Fílidas,Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sellthem in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own.If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana,I’ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I’llcall her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the samething; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify hiswife Teresa Panza as Teresaina.”Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curatebestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he hadmade, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he couldspare from his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him,recommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treathimself to a suitable diet.It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three ofthem said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in toDon Quixote, and said the niece, “What’s this, uncle? Now that we werethinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectablelife there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and turn‘young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going there?’Nay! indeed ‘the straw is too hard now to make pipes of.’”“And,” added the housekeeper, “will your worship be able to bear, outin the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter, and thehowling of the wolves? Not you; for that’s a life and a business forhardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time theywere in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it’s better tobe a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, señor; take myadvice—and I’m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, butfasting, and with fifty years upon my head—stay at home, look afteryour affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon mysoul be it if any evil comes to you.”“Hold your peace, my daughters,” said Don Quixote; “I know very wellwhat my duty is; help me to bed, for I don’t feel very well; and restassured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shallnever fail to have a care for your interests, as you will see in theend.” And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedly were), thehousekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him somethingto eat and made him as comfortable as possible.CHAPTER LXXIV.OF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE MADE, AND HOW HE DIEDp74a.jpg (96K)Full SizeAs nothing that is man’s can last for ever, but all tends everdownwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man’s life, andas Don Quixote’s enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stayits course, its end and close came when he least looked for it.For—whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced,or of heaven’s will that so ordered it—a fever settled upon him andkept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited byhis friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his goodsquire Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that itwas grief at finding himself vanquished, and the object of his heart,the liberation and disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kepthim in this state, strove by all the means in their power to cheer himup; the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin hispastoral life, for which he himself, he said, had already composed aneclogue that would take the shine out of all Sannazaro had everwritten, and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard theflock, one called Barcino and the other Butron, which a herdsman ofQuintanar had sold him.But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. Hisfriends called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very wellsatisfied with it, and said that in any case it would be well for himto attend to the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a badway. Don Quixote heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, hisniece, and his squire, who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had himlying dead before them. The doctor’s opinion was that melancholy anddepression were bringing him to his end. Don Quixote begged them toleave him to himself, as he had a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed,and he slept at one stretch, as the saying is, more than six hours, sothat the housekeeper and niece thought he was going to sleep for ever.But at the end of that time he woke up, and in a loud voice exclaimed,“Blessed be Almighty God, who has shown me such goodness. In truth hismercies are boundless, and the sins of men can neither limit them norkeep them back!”The niece listened with attention to her uncle’s words, and they struckher as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least duringhis illness, so she asked, “What are you saying, señor? Has anythingstrange occurred? What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?”“The mercies, niece,” said Don Quixote, “are those that God has thismoment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are no impediment tothem. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark shadows ofignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books ofchivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities anddeceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of myillusions has come so late that it leaves me no time to make someamends by reading other books that might be a light to my soul. Niece,I feel myself at the point of death, and I would fain meet it in such away as to show that my life has not been so ill that I should leavebehind me the name of a madman; for though I have been one, I would notthat the fact should be made plainer at my death. Call in to me, mydear, my good friends the curate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, andMaster Nicholas the barber, for I wish to confess and make my will.”But his niece was saved the trouble by the entrance of the three. Theinstant Don Quixote saw them he exclaimed, “Good news for you, goodsirs, that I am no longer Don Quixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano,whose way of life won for him the name of Good. Now am I the enemy ofAmadis of Gaul and of the whole countless troop of his descendants;odious to me now are all the profane stories of knight-errantry; now Iperceive my folly, and the peril into which reading them brought me;now, by God’s mercy schooled into my right senses, I loathe them.”When the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whateverthat some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson,“What? Señor Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the ladyDulcinea being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as weare on the point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, likeprinces, are you thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven’s sake,be rational and let’s have no more nonsense.”“All that nonsense,” said Don Quixote, “that until now has been areality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven’s help, turn to my good.I feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a truce to jesting;let me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to make my will;for in extremities like this, man must not trifle with his soul; andwhile the curate is confessing me let someone, I beg, go for thenotary.”They looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote’s words; but,though uncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of thesigns by which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this sosudden and complete return to his senses after having been mad; for tothe words already quoted he added much more, so well expressed, sodevout, and so rational, as to banish all doubt and convince them thathe was sound of mind. The curate turned them all out, and left alonewith him confessed him. The bachelor went for the notary and returnedshortly afterwards with him and with Sancho, who, having alreadylearned from the bachelor the condition his master was in, and findingthe housekeeper and niece weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.The confession over, the curate came out saying, “Alonso Quixano theGood is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go into him while he makes his will.”This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of thehousekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tearsburst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of atruth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixanothe Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of agentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he wasbeloved, not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of thewill had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to Godwith all the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests,he said, “Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in thehands of Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuchas between him and me there have been certain accounts and debits andcredits, no claim be made against him, nor any account demanded of himin respect of them; but that if anything remain over and above, afterhe has paid himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be butlittle, shall be his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when Iwas mad I had a share in giving him the government of an island, so,now that I am in my senses, I could give him that of a kingdom, itshould be his, for the simplicity of his character and the fidelity ofhis conduct deserve it.” And then, turning to Sancho, he said, “Forgiveme, my friend, that I led thee to seem as mad as myself, making theefall into the same error I myself fell into, that there were and stillare knights-errant in the world.”“Ah!” said Sancho weeping, “don’t die, master, but take my advice andlive many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life isto let himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killinghim, or any hands but melancholy’s making an end of him. Come, don’t belazy, but get up from your bed and let us take to the fields inshepherd’s trim as we agreed. Perhaps behind some bush we shall findthe lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. If it be thatyou are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame onme, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinante badly;besides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is acommon thing for knights to upset one another, and for him who isconquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.”“Very true,” said Samson, “and good Sancho Panza’s view of these casesis quite right.”“Sirs, not so fast,” said Don Quixote, “‘in last year’s nests there areno birds this year.’ I was mad, now I am in my senses; I was DonQuixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said, Alonso Quixano the Good; andmay my repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used tohave for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.“Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my niece,here present, after all has been deducted from the most availableportion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made.And the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of thewages I owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twentyducats, over and above, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor SamsonCarrasco, now present, I appoint my executors.“Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires tomarry, she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of allascertained by information taken that he does not know what books ofchivalry are; and if it should be proved that he does, and if, in spiteof this, my niece insists upon marrying him, and does marry him, thenthat she shall forfeit the whole of what I have left her, which myexecutors shall devote to works of charity as they please.“Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if anyhappy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said tohave written a history now going about under the title of ‘Second Partof the Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,’ they beg of him on mybehalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, withoutintending it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrousabsurdities as he has written in it; for I am leaving the world with afeeling of compunction at having provoked him to write them.”With this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him hestretched himself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutterand made haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived afterthat on which he made his will he fainted away very often. The housewas all in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drankand Sancho Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out orsoftens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might beexpected to leave behind him.p74b.jpg (391K)Full SizeAt last Don Quixote’s end came, after he had received all thesacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed hisdetestation of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, andhe said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of anyknight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as DonQuixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded uphis spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged thenotary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly calledDon Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, anddied naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to removethe possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringinghim to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of hisachievements.Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose villageCide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all thetowns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for theright to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities ofGreece contended for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the nieceand housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon histomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines:A doughty gentleman lies here;A stranger all his life to fear;Nor in his death could Death prevail,In that last hour, to make him quail.He for the world but little cared;And at his feats the world was scared;A crazy man his life he passed,But in his senses died at last.And said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, “Rest here, hung up by thisbrass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make orclumsy cut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unlesspresumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.But ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say tothem:Hold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!Adventure it let none,For this emprise, my lord the king,Was meant for me alone.For me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act,mine to write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and inspite of that pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or wouldventure with his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write theachievements of my valiant knight;—no burden for his shoulders, norsubject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come toknow him, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the wearymouldering bones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off,in opposition to all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, makinghim rise from the grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched atfull length, powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; forthe two that he has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approvalof everybody to whom they have become known, in this as well as inforeign countries, are quite sufficient for the purpose of turning intoridicule the whole of those made by the whole set of theknights-errant; and so doing shalt thou discharge thy Christiancalling, giving good counsel to one that bears ill-will to thee. And Ishall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the first who has everenjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he could desire; for mydesire has been no other than to deliver over to the detestation ofmankind the false and foolish tales of the books of chivalry, which,thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now tottering, anddoubtless doomed to fall for ever.
