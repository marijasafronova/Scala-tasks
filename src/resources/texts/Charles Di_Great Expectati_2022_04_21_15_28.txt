Chapter LIX.[Illustration]Chapter I.My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, myinfant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicitthan Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of histombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness ofeither of them (for their days were long before the days ofphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like wereunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters onmy father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,“_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,” I drew a childish conclusion thatmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, eachabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row besidetheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers ofmine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in thatuniversal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiouslyentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their handsin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this stateof existence.Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the riverwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broadimpression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained ona memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found outfor certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was thechurchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and alsoGeorgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of theaforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wildernessbeyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the lowleaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair fromwhich the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle ofshivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up fromamong the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, youlittle devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A manwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round hishead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, andlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn bybriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whoseteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it,sir.”“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”“Pip, sir.”“Once more,” said the man, staring at me. “Give it mouth!”“Pip. Pip, sir.”“Show us where you live,” said the man. “Pint out the place!”I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among thealder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, andemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that hemade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under myfeet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a hightombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.[Illustration]“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks youha’ got.”I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for myyears, and not strong.“Darn me if I couldn’t eat ’em,” said the man, with a threatening shakeof his head, “and if I han’t half a mind to’t!”I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter to thetombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;partly, to keep myself from crying.“Now lookee here!” said the man. “Where’s your mother?”“There, sir!” said I.He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.“There, sir!” I timidly explained. “Also Georgiana. That’s my mother.”“Oh!” said he, coming back. “And is that your father alonger yourmother?”“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”“Ha!” he muttered then, considering. “Who d’ye live with,—supposin’you’re kindly let to live, which I han’t made up my mind about?”“My sister, sir,—Mrs. Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,sir.”“Blacksmith, eh?” said he. And looked down at his leg.After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer tomy tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as hecould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,and mine looked most helplessly up into his.“Now lookee here,” he said, “the question being whether you’re to belet to live. You know what a file is?”“Yes, sir.”“And you know what wittles is?”“Yes, sir.”After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me agreater sense of helplessness and danger.“You get me a file.” He tilted me again. “And you get me wittles.” Hetilted me again. “You bring ’em both to me.” He tilted me again. “OrI’ll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again.I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with bothhands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,sir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumpedover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an uprightposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. Youbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, andyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning yourhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shallbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, nomatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be toreout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.There’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man Iam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man hasa secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at hisheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hidehimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm inbed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may thinkhimself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep andcreep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young manfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. Ifind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, whatdo you say?”I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what brokenbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early inthe morning.“Say Lord strike you dead if you don’t!” said the man.I said so, and he took me down.“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and youremember that young man, and you get home!”“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered.“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. “Iwish I was a frog. Or a eel!”At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both hisarms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limpedtowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among thenettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he lookedin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon hisankle and pull him in.When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whoselegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. WhenI saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use ofmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going onagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, andpicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped intothe marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains wereheavy or the tide was in.The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stoppedto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, notnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of longangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of theriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all theprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was thebeacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon apole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, withsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man waslimping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,and come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me aterrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting theirheads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. Ilooked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs ofhim. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.Chapter II.My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighboursbecause she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to findout for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have ahard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon herhusband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were bothbrought up by hand.She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a generalimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joewas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smoothface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed tohave somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sortof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailingredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possibleshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was talland bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over herfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib infront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerfulmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore thisapron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have wornit at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have takenit off, every day of her life.Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many ofthe dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time. When Iran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe wassitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, andhaving confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the momentI raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,sitting in the chimney corner.“Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she’sout now, making it a baker’s dozen.”“Is she?”“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoatround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Ticklerwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickledframe.“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab atTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowlyclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking atit; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger speciesof child, and as no more than my equal.“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on theRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She’s a-coming! Getbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded bythrowing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad toget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietlyfenced me up there with his great leg.“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping herfoot. “Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away withfret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if youwas fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying andrubbing myself.“Churchyard!” repeated my sister. “If it warn’t for me you’d have beento the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up byhand?”“You did,” said I.“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister.I whimpered, “I don’t know.”“_I_ don’t!” said my sister. “I’d never do it again! I know that. I maytruly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) withoutbeing your mother.”My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately atthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, themysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I wasunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before mein the avenging coals.“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. “Churchyard,indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,had not said it at all. “You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixtyou, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be withoutme!”As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at meover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, andcalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under thegrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling hisright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about withhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hardand fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, andsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then shetook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—usingboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming andmoulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife afinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a verythick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from theloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadfulacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knewMrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that mylarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg ofmy trousers.The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose Ifound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leapfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In ouralready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in hisgood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to comparethe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to eachother’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fastdiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but hefound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and myuntouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperatelyconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it hadbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with thecircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked atme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my lossof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which hedidn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer thanusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down likea pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head onone side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he sawthat my bread and butter was gone.The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold ofhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’sobservation.“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very seriousremonstrance. “Pip, old chap! You’ll do yourself a mischief. It’llstick somewhere. You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to doit,” said Joe, all aghast. “Manners is manners, but still your elth’syour elth.”By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a littlewhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, lookingguiltily on.“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out ofbreath, “you staring great stuck pig.”Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, andlooked at me again.“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,any time. But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floorbetween us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was yourage—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I neversee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolteddead.”My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, sayingnothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a finemedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At thebest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as achoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling likea new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demandeda pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greatercomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would beheld in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made toswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching andmeditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging frommyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had hadnone before.Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, inthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secretburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a greatpunishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—Inever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of thehousekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keepingone hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered aboutthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard thevoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me tosecrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve untilto-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if theyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing hishands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or shouldmistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart andliver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood onend with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody’sever did?It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, witha copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it withthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with theload on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring thebread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slippedaway, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a finalwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that greatguns, Joe?”“Ah!” said Joe. “There’s another conwict off.”“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,“Escaped. Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tar-water.While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put mymouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?” Joe put_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “aftersunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they’refiring warning of another.”“_Who’s_ firing?” said I.“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,“what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you’ll be told nolies.”It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should betold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was politeunless there was company.At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmostpains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of aword that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed toMrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joewouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could makenothing of the word.“Mrs. Joe,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if youwouldn’t much mind—where the firing comes from?”“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite meanthat but rather the contrary. “From the Hulks!”“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe. “Hulks!”Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”“And please, what’s Hulks?” said I.“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me outwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. “Answer him onequestion, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,right ’cross th’ meshes.” We always used that name for marshes, in ourcountry.“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put there?” saidI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. “I tell you what,young fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to badgerpeople’s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by askingquestions. Now, you get along to bed!”I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I wentupstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe’s thimblehaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—Ifelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks werehandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by askingquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thoughtthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was inmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was inmortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortalterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I hadno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed meat every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done onrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself driftingdown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly piratecalling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed thegibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there atonce, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had beeninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must robthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was nogetting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must havestruck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the verypirate himself rattling his chains.As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window wasshot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Getup, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly suppliedthan usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a harehanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my backwas half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time forselection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stolesome bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which Itied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), somebrandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I hadsecretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle froma jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, anda beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without thepie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was thatwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was notintended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; Iunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at whichI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for themisty marshes.Chapter III.It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on theoutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying thereall night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I sawthe damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sortof spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was sothick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to ourvillage—a direction which they never accepted, for they never camethere—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as Ilooked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed consciencelike a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so thatinstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes andbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainlyas could be, “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie! Stop him!” Thecattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One blackox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened consciencesomething of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, andmoved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I movedround, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir! It wasn’tfor myself I took it!” Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud ofsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs anda flourish of his tail.All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast Iwent, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. Iknew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down thereon a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me thatwhen I was ’prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larksthere! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at lasttoo far to the right, and consequently had to try back along theriver-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakesthat staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, Ihad just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, andhad just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the mansitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him onthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, butanother man!And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great ironon his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything thatthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flatbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, forI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit atme,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himselfdown, for it made him stumble,—and then he ran into the mist, stumblingtwice as he went, and I lost him.“It’s the young man!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identifiedhim. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I hadknown where it was.I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the rightman,—hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never allnight left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me. He was awfullycold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my faceand die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, thatwhen I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, itoccurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen mybundle. He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied mypockets.“What’s in the bottle, boy?” said he.“Brandy,” said I.He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curiousmanner,—more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violenthurry, than a man who was eating it,—but he left off to take some ofthe liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quiteas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between histeeth, without biting it off.“I think you have got the ague,” said I.“I’m much of your opinion, boy,” said he.“It’s bad about here,” I told him. “You’ve been lying out on themeshes, and they’re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.”“I’ll eat my breakfast afore they’re the death of me,” said he. “I’d dothat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there isover there, directly afterwards. I’ll beat the shivers so far, I’ll betyou.”He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, allat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all roundus, and often stopping—even stopping his jaws—to listen. Some real orfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon themarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,—“You’re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?”“No, sir! No!”“Nor giv’ no one the office to follow you?”“No!”“Well,” said he, “I believe you. You’d be but a fierce young houndindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretchedwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmintis!”Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve overhis eyes.Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled downupon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”“Did you speak?”“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”“Thankee, my boy. I do.”I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I nownoticed a decided similarity between the dog’s way of eating, and theman’s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. Heswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thoughtthere was danger in every direction of somebody’s coming to take thepie away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, toappreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine withhim, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all ofwhich particulars he was very like the dog.“I am afraid you won’t leave any of it for him,” said I, timidly; aftera silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of makingthe remark. “There’s no more to be got where that came from.” It wasthe certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.“Leave any for him? Who’s him?” said my friend, stopping in hiscrunching of pie-crust.“The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.”“Oh ah!” he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. “Him? Yes,yes! _He_ don’t want no wittles.”“I thought he looked as if he did,” said I.The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny andthe greatest surprise.“Looked? When?”“Just now.”“Where?”“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found him noddingasleep, and thought it was you.”He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think hisfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling;“and—and”—I was very anxious to put this delicately—“and with—the samereason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn’t you hear the cannon lastnight?”“Then there _was_ firing!” he said to himself.“I wonder you shouldn’t have been sure of that,” I returned, “for weheard it up at home, and that’s farther away, and we were shut inbesides.”“Why, see now!” said he. “When a man’s alone on these flats, with alight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hearsnothin’ all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He seesthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carriedafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himselfchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders ‘Makeready! Present! Cover him steady, men!’ and is laid hands on—andthere’s nothin’! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming upin order, Damn ’em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred. And as tofiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broadday,—But this man”; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten mybeing there; “did you notice anything in him?”“He had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew Iknew.“Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,with the flat of his hand.“Yes, there!”“Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the breast ofhis grey jacket. “Show me the way he went. I’ll pull him down, like abloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,boy.”I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, andhe looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wetgrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or mindinghis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but whichhe handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himselfinto this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keepingaway from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice,so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I sawof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at hisfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The lastI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was stillgoing.Chapter IV.I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take meup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yetbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting thehouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put uponthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article intowhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister wasvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.“And where the deuce ha’ _you_ been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmassalutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.I said I had been down to hear the Carols. “Ah! well!” observed Mrs.Joe. “You might ha’ done worse.” Not a doubt of that I thought.“Perhaps if I warn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same thing) aslave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear theCarols,” said Mrs. Joe. “I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, andthat’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan hadretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with aconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when hereyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, andexhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, forweeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as totheir legs.We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled porkand greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie hadbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat notbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensivearrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect ofbreakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain’t a-going to have noformal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve gotbefore me, I promise you!”So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops ona forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps ofmilk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on thedresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, andtacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace theold one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of theyear in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the fourlittle white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a blacknose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart ofthe other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisiteart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable thandirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do thesame by their religion.My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, thatis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was awell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, hewas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; andeverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festiveoccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a youngoffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) anddelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outragedmajesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on beingborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when Iwas taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to makethem like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have thefree use of my limbs.Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectaclefor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing towhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to beequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands haddone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether theChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of theterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceivedthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergymansaid, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise andpropose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being surethat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting tothis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubblethe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle,but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler inthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour washalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, andMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, andeverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, andthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a largeshining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proudof; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you couldonly give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; hehimself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning tocompetition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Churchnot being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk. But hepunished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—alwaysgiving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, asmuch as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with youropinion of this style!”I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit ofours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next toMr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ wasnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.“Mrs. Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-agedslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hairstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just beenall but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as thecompliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherrywine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, withexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “O, Un—clePum-ble—chook! This _is_ kind!” Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as henow retorted, “It’s no more than your merits. And now are you allbobbish, and how’s Sixpennorth of halfpence?” meaning me.We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nutsand oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very likeJoe’s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sisterwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generallymore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. Iremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had marriedMr. Hubble,—I don’t know at what remote period,—when she was muchyounger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legsextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw somemiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’trobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed inat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, andthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed tospeak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with thescaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscurecorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reasonto be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only haveleft me alone. But they wouldn’t leave me alone. They seemed to thinkthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,every now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been anunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touchedup by these moral goads.It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace withtheatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like areligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—andended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a lowreproachful voice, “Do you hear that? Be grateful.”“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them whichbrought you up by hand.”Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournfulpresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that theyoung are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for thecompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterallywicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and looked at me in aparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.Joe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) whenthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided andcomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always didso at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There beingplenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, abouthalf a pint.A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon withsome severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of theChurch being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon _he_ would have giventhem. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, heremarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, illchosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so manysubjects “going about.”“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook. “You’ve hit it, sir! Plenty ofsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon theirtails. That’s what’s wanted. A man needn’t go far to find a subject, ifhe’s ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added, after a shortinterval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone. There’s a subject! If youwant a subject, look at Pork!”“True, sir. Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle,—and Iknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deducedfrom that text.”(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)Joe gave me some more gravy.“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing hisfork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—“swinewere the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is putbefore us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well inhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)“What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.”“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, ratherirritably, “but there is no girl present.”“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think whatyou’ve got to be grateful for. If you’d been born a Squeaker—”“He _was_, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically.Joe gave me some more gravy.“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “Ifyou had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—”“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who hadan objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with hiselders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, androlling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, hewouldn’t. And what would have been your destination?” turning on meagain. “You would have been disposed of for so many shillings accordingto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher wouldhave come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whippedyou under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up hisfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he wouldhave shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.Not a bit of it!”Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble,commiserating my sister.“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearfulcatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the actsof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbledfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries Ihad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and Ihad contumaciously refused to go there.I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, withtheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, inconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, duringthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull ituntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing incomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when thepause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in whichpause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) withindignation and abhorrence.“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to thetheme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich,too; ain’t it?”“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would sayit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table underthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched mantrifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, putit down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe werebriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.I couldn’t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of thetable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger hisglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink thebrandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized withunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turninground several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, andrushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,and apparently out of his mind.I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn’t know how Ihad done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In mydreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, andsurveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would beworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement. “Why, how ever could Tar comethere?”But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn’thear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it allaway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who hadbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively ingetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, andmixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held onto the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor ofgratitude.By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake ofpudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under thegenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get overthe day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates,—cold.”I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to mybosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of mysoul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really wasgone.“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her bestgrace—“you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and deliciouspresent of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savory porkpie.”The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible ofhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously,all things considered,—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we’ll do our best endeavours;let us have a cut at this same pie.”My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite inthe Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bitof savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and dono harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have neverbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt thatI could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg ofthe table, and ran for my life.But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremostinto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out apair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”Chapter V.The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of theirloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise fromtable in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchenempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of“Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone—with the—pie!”The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; atwhich crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was thesergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at thecompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in hisright hand, and his left on my shoulder.“Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,” said the sergeant, “but as I havementioned at the door to this smart young shaver,” (which he hadn’t),“I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.”“And pray what might you want with _him_?” retorted my sister, quick toresent his being wanted at all.“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I shouldreply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance;speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time pickedout Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I findthe lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act pretty.As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye overthem?”Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job wouldnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer twohours than one. “Will it? Then will you set about it at once,blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’sservice. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they’ll makethemselves useful.” With that, he called to his men, who came troopinginto the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their handsloosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now,easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly overtheir high stocks, out into the yard.All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I wasin an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that thehandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got thebetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a littlemore of my scattered wits.“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself toMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified theinference that he was equal to the time.“It’s just gone half past two.”“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I wasforced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do. How far might you callyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?”“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.“That’ll do. We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk. A little beforedusk, my orders are. That’ll do.”“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two. They’re pretty well known to be outon the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em beforedusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought ofme.“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in acircle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you’reready, his Majesty the King is.”Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leatherapron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened itswooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at thebellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. ThenJoe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the generalattention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beerfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take aglass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine,Mum. I’ll engage there’s no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked himand said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would takewine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank hisMajesty’s health and compliments of the season, and took it all at amouthful and smacked his lips.“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect thatstuff’s of _your_ providing.”Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay? Why?”“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, “you’rea man that knows what’s what.”“D’ye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. “Haveanother glass!”“With you. Hob and nob,” returned the sergeant. “The top of mine to thefoot of yours,—the foot of yours to the top of mine,—Ring once, ringtwice,—the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you livea thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than youare at the present moment of your life!”The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready foranother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitalityappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took thebottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in agush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the winethat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about withthe same liberality, when the first was gone.As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for adinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyedthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightenedwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in livelyanticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellowsseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoketo hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, andall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as theblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the paleafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to haveturned pale on their account, poor wretches.At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. AsJoe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of usshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he wasagreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never shouldhave got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to knowall about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, “Ifyou bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’tlook to me to put it together again.”The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fullysensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as whensomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, andto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out inthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, Itreasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.” andJoe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run,Pip.”We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather wascold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness comingon, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. Afew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none cameout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’shand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among thegraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without findinganything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gateat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against ushere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they littlethought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both menhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we shouldcome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I whohad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceivingimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined thehunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound intreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe’sback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like ahunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, andto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into apretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were takingthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and themound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,though all of a watery lead colour.With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, Ilooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, Icould hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, byhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, andcould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadfulstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only asheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, staredangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, exceptthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and wewere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we allstopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, along shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, butit was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raisedtogether,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking undertheir breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment’s listening,Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should notbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his menshould make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I hadto hold on tight to keep my seat.It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words hespoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and overgates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: noman cared where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it becamemore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater ratethan ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice,“Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!” Thenboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then wouldbreak out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran likedeer, and Joe too.The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, andtwo of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked andlevelled when we all ran in.“Here are both men!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of aditch. “Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Comeasunder!”Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,and blows were being struck, when some more men went down into theditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict andthe other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating andstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his raggedsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: “_I_ took him! _I_give him up to you! Mind that!”“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll doyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffsthere!”“I don’t expect it to do me any good. I don’t want it to do me moregood than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh. “I tookhim. He knows it. That’s enough for me.”The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the oldbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were bothseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself fromfalling.“Take notice, guard,—he tried to murder me,” were his first words.“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully. “Try, and not doit? I took him, and giv’ him up; that’s what I done. I not onlyprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,—draggedhim this far on his way back. He’s a gentleman, if you please, thisvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murderhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and draghim back!”The other one still gasped, “He tried—he tried-to—murder me. Bear—bearwitness.”“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant. “Single-handed I gotclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha’ gotclear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won’t findmuch iron on it—if I hadn’t made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_make a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I haddied at the bottom there,” and he made an emphatic swing at the ditchwith his manacled hands, “I’d have held to him with that grip, that youshould have been safe to find him in my hold.”The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of hiscompanion, repeated, “He tried to murder me. I should have been a deadman if you had not come up.”“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy. “He’s a liar born, andhe’ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain’t it written there? Let himturn those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.”The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,however, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any setexpression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes andat the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.“Do you see him?” pursued my convict. “Do you see what a villain he is?Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That’s how he lookedwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me.”The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyesrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a momenton the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and witha half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convictbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon himbut for the interposition of the soldiers. “Didn’t I tell you,” saidthe other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And anyone could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out uponhis lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant. “Light those torches.”As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, wentdown on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the firsttime, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of theditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerlywhen he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. Ihad been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of myinnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehendedmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and itall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for aday, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as havingbeen more attentive.The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or fourtorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had beenalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwardsvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing ina ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torcheskindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on theopposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the sergeant. “March.”We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with asound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are expectedon board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.Don’t straggle, my man. Close up here.”The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separateguard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of thetorches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved tosee it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably goodpath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here andthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddysluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights comingin after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire uponthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. Icould see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the airabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed ratherto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. Wecould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hutand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there wasa smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and astand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like anovergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about adozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it intheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted theirheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeantmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then theconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,to go on board first.My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in thehut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting uphis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as ifhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to thesergeant, and remarked,—“I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent somepersons laying under suspicion alonger me.”“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coollylooking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to say ithere. You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear aboutit, before it’s done with, you know.”“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can’tstarve; at least _I_ can’t. I took some wittles, up at the willage overyonder,—where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”“You mean stole,” said the sergeant.“And I’ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith’s.”“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.“It was some broken wittles—that’s what it was—and a dram of liquor,and a pie.”“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” askedthe sergeant, confidentially.“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don’t you know,Pip?”“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, andwithout the least glance at me,—“so you’re the blacksmith, are you?Than I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”“God knows you’re welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returnedJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. “We don’t know what youhave done, but we wouldn’t have you starved to death for it, poormiserable fellow-creatur.—Would us, Pip?”The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throatagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guardwere ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of roughstakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by acrew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, orinterested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, orspoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,“Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By thelight of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way fromthe mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark. Cribbed and barred andmoored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyesto be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and wesaw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torcheswere flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all overwith him.Chapter VI.My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been sounexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but Ihope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in referenceto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But Iloved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days thanbecause the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner selfwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly whenI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joethe whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrustedthat if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losingJoe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner atnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied upmy tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, Inever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fairwhisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joeknew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, atyesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on to-day’s table, withoutthinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic liferemarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that hesuspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been toocowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had nointercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of itsmany inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, Imade the discovery of the line of action for myself.As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe tookme on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresomejourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very badtemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably haveexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. Inhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such aninsane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at thekitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would havehanged him, if it had been a capital offence.By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a littledrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and throughhaving been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights andnoise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thumpbetween the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah! Was thereever such a boy as this!” from my sister,) I found Joe telling themabout the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggestingdifferent ways by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechookmade out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first gotupon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of thehouse, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope madeof his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was verypositive and drove his own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreedthat it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” withthe feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coaton, he was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention his smoking hardbehind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the dampout: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as aslumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up to bedwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to bedangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, asI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lastedlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentionedsaving on exceptional occasions.Chapter VII.At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the familytombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. Myconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for Iread “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’sexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relationshad been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formedthe worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were mynotions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, atall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed mydeclaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,”laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from ourhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning downby the wheelwright’s or up by the mill.When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until Icould assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called“Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not onlyodd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extraboy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I wasfavoured with the employment. In order, however, that our superiorposition might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on thekitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all myearnings were dropped. I have an impression that they were to becontributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt,but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that isto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimitedinfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, inthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for theimproving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used tooverhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, andoccasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr.Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter. What he did on thoseoccasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us MarkAntony’s oration over the body of Caesar. This was always followed byCollins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, andtaking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was notwith me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society ofthe Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to thedisadvantage of both gentlemen.Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,kept in the same room—a little general shop. She had no idea what stockshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was alittle greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as aCatalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shoptransactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; Iconfess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, whatrelation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me,too, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought,in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mendingand pulling up at heel. This description must be received with aweek-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.Wopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had beena bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by everyletter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, whoseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves andbaffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, toread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expendinggreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it musthave been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was along time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabeton the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or twoto print and smear this epistle:—“MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGEU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX ANBLEVE ME INF XN PIP.”There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe byletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I deliveredthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joereceived it as a miracle of erudition.“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what ascholar you are! An’t you?”“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.“Why, here’s a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to anythink! Here’s a J anda O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”[Illustration]I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than thismonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when Iaccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suithis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing toembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, Ishould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah! But read therest, Jo.”“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searchingeye, “One, two, three. Why, here’s three Js, and three Os, and threeJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!”I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him thewhole letter.“Astonishing!” said Joe, when I had finished. “You ARE a scholar.”“How do you spell Gargery, Joe?” I asked him, with a modest patronage.“I don’t spell it at all,” said Joe.“But supposing you did?”“It _can’t_ be supposed,” said Joe. “Tho’ I’m uncommon fond of reading,too.”“Are you, Joe?”“On-common. Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, andsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!” hecontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you _do_ come to a Jand a O, and says you, ‘Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,’ how interestingreading is!”I derived from this, that Joe’s education, like Steam, was yet in itsinfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—“Didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”“No, Pip.”“Why didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to hisusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the firebetween the lower bars; “I’ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were givento drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at mymother, most onmerciful. It were a’most the only hammering he did,indeed, ’xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only tobe equalled by the wigor with which he didn’t hammer at hisanwil.—You’re a listening and understanding, Pip?”“Yes, Joe.”“Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father severaltimes; and then my mother she’d go out to work, and she’d say, “Joe,”she’d say, “now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,” andshe’d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart thathe couldn’t abear to be without us. So, he’d come with a mosttremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses wherewe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with usand to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.Which, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of thefire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”“Certainly, poor Joe!”“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of thepoker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo, and maintainingequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in hishart, don’t you see?”I didn’t see; but I didn’t say so.“Well!” Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or thepot won’t bile, don’t you know?”I saw that, and said so.“Consequence, my father didn’t make objections to my going to work; soI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he wouldhave followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure _you_, Pip. Intime I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in apurple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon histombstone that, Whatsume’er the failings on his part, Remember readerhe were that good in his heart.”Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and carefulperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self. I made it in a moment. It was likestriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was somuch surprised in all my life,—couldn’t credit my own ed,—to tell youthe truth, hardly believed it _were_ my own ed. As I was saying, Pip,it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costsmoney, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Notto mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted formy mother. She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren’t long offollowing, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.”Joe’s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them,and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner,with the round knob on the top of the poker.“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I gotacquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,”—Joe looked firmly at me as ifhe knew I was not going to agree with him;—“your sister is a finefigure of a woman.”I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world’s opinions, on thatsubject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with thepoker after every word following, “a-fine-figure—of—a—woman!”I could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so,Joe.”“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up. “_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what doesit signify to Me?”I sagaciously observed, if it didn’t signify to him, to whom did itsignify?“Certainly!” assented Joe. “That’s it. You’re right, old chap! When Igot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringingyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,along with all the folks. As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenanceexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could havebeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you’d haveformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”Not exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity. “When Ioffered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church atsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said toher, ‘And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor littlechild,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for _him_ at the forge!’”I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends;an’t us, Pip? Don’t cry, old chap!”When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That’s about where it lights;here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and Itell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn’tsee too much of what we’re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on thesly. And why on the sly? I’ll tell you why, Pip.”He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he couldhave proceeded in his demonstration.“Your sister is given to government.”“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in afavour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.“Given to government,” said Joe. “Which I meantersay the government ofyou and myself.”“Oh!”“And she an’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joecontinued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being ascholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don’t yousee?”I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—”when Joe stopped me.“Stay a bit. I know what you’re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! Idon’t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. Idon’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop downupon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candourcompels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capitalBs.“Why don’t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,Pip?”“Yes, Joe.”“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he mightfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to thatplacid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind. A master-mind.”“What’s that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. ButJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completelystopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,“Her.”“And I ain’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,and got back to his whisker. “And last of all, Pip,—and this I want tosay very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor mother, ofa woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and nevergetting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead afeerd of goingwrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a woman, and I’d furrather of the two go wrong the t’other way, and be a littleill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; Iwish there warn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take itall on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, andI hope you’ll overlook shortcomings.”Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe fromthat night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking abouthim, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking upto Joe in my heart.“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s theDutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of ’em,and she’s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook’s mare mayn’thave set a forefoot on a piece o’ ice, and gone down.”Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required awoman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing noconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joewas out on one of these expeditions.Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door tolisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blewkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night oflying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up tothem as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all theglittering multitude.“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, asshe came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,ready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they mightsee a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen thatnothing might be out of its place. When we had completed thesepreparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soonlanded, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare witha cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold airin with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, andthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,“if this boy ain’t grateful this night, he never will be!”I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was whollyuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pompeyed.But I have my fears.”“She ain’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “She knowsbetter.”She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,“She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips andeyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back ofhis hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on suchoccasions, and looked at her.“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way. “What are you staring at?Is the house afire?”“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister. “Unless you call MissHavisham a he. And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister.“She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he’s going. Andhe had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me as anencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work him.”I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round hadheard of Miss Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lady wholived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and wholed a life of seclusion.“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded. “I wonder how she come to knowPip!”“Noodle!” cried my sister. “Who said she knew him?”“—Which some individual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned thatshe wanted him to go and play there.”“And couldn’t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go andplay there? Isn’t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may bea tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes—we won’t say quarterly orhalf-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—butsometimes—go there to pay his rent? And couldn’t she then ask UnclePumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn’tUncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful forus—though you may not think it, Joseph,” in a tone of the deepestreproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, “then mention thisboy, standing Prancing here”—which I solemnly declare I was notdoing—“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?”“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook. “Well put! Prettily pointed!Good indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.”“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joeapologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,“you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case. You mayconsider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph. For you do not knowthat Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,this boy’s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham’s, hasoffered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and tokeep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to MissHavisham’s to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!” cried my sister,casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, “here I stand talking tomere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catchingcold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hairof his head to the sole of his foot!”With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my facewas squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under tapsof water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, andthumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite besidemyself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be betteracquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of awedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of thestiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and wastrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then deliveredover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were theSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had beendying to make all along: “Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, butespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!”“Good-bye, Joe!”“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and whatwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. Butthey twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on thequestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham’s, and whaton earth I was expected to play at.Chapter VIII.Mr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High Street of the market town, wereof a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of acornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must bea very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, andsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seedsand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, andbloom.It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained thisspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed inan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where thebedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of myeyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinitybetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so didhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about thecorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air andflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that Ihardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me fornoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business bylooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared toget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplatingthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, alwaysporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, andalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through theglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in theHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlourbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch ofbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I consideredMr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by mysister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to beimparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible incombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warmwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left themilk out altogether,—his conversation consisted of nothing butarithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,pompously, “Seven times nine, boy?” And how should _I_ be able toanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! Iwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sumthat lasted all through the breakfast. “Seven?” “And four?” “Andeight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on. And after eachfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or asup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)a gorging and gormandizing manner.For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we startedfor Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding themanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof. Within aquarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of oldbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of thewindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower wererustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; sowe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come toopen it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), andsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewingwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long longtime.A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To whichmy conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,”and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across thecourt-yard, with keys in her hand.“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty andseemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.“Oh!” she said. “Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook,discomfited.“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could notprotest. But he eyed me severely,—as if _I_ had done anything tohim!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy! Letyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up byhand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back topropound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. Thebrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and thewooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stoodopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and itmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of thebrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.She saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without hurtall the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way.“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;don’t you think so?”“It looks like it, miss.”“Not that anybody means to try,” she added, “for that’s all done with,and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strongbeer, there’s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the ManorHouse.”[Illustration]“Is that the name of this house, miss?”“One of its names, boy.”“It has more than one, then, miss?”“One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, orHebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said. It meant, when itwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. Theymust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. Butdon’t loiter, boy.”Though she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that wasfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed mucholder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful andself-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had beenone-and-twenty, and a queen.We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had twochains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that thepassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”To this she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.”And scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle withher.This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the onlything to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was toldfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in apretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse ofdaylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposedfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quiteunknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gildedlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’sdressing-table.Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been nofine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbowresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat thestrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.She was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all ofwhite. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependentfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair waswhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, andsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendidthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,—theother was on the table near her hand,—her veil was but half arranged,her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom laywith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and someflowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about thelooking-glass.It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, thoughI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But Isaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had beenwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I sawthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, andlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of hersunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figureof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose hadshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastlywaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personagelying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churchesto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out ofa vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed tohave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, ifI could.“Who is it?” said the lady at the table.“Pip, ma’am.”“Pip?”“Mr. Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am. Come—to play.”“Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.”It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note ofthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stoppedat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped attwenty minutes to nine.“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham. “You are not afraid of a woman whohas never seen the sun since you were born?”I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous liecomprehended in the answer “No.”“Do you know what I touch here?” she said, laying her hands, one uponthe other, on her left side.“Yes, ma’am.” (It made me think of the young man.)“What do I touch?”“Your heart.”“Broken!”She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, andwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kepther hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as ifthey were heavy.“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham. “I want diversion, and I have donewith men and women. Play.”I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that shecould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in thewide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancythat I want to see some play. There, there!” with an impatient movementof the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, Ihad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumedcharacter of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart. But I felt myself sounequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at MissHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch asshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—“Are you sullen and obstinate?”“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play justnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, soI would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange, and sofine,—and melancholy—.” I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or hadalready said it, and we took another look at each other.Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at thedress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself inthe looking-glass.“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him, sofamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.”As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought shewas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me. “You can do that.Call Estella. At the door.”To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible norresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,was almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, andher light came along the dark passage like a star.Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from thetable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against herpretty brown hair. “Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use itwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.”“With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,—only it seemed sounlikely,—“Well? You can break his heart.”“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatestdisdain.“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.It was then I began to understand that everything in the room hadstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed thatMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she hadtaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at thedressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, nowyellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which theshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, nowyellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even thewithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so likegrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings andtrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knewnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodiesburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of beingdistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must havelooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would havestruck her to dust.“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has! And whatthick boots!”I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began toconsider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was sostrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when Iknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me fora stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she lookedon. “She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. Whatdo you think of her?”“I don’t like to say,” I stammered.“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down.“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.“Anything else?”“I think she is very pretty.”“Anything else?”“I think she is very insulting.” (She was looking at me then with alook of supreme aversion.)“Anything else?”“I think I should like to go home.”“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I shouldlike to go home now.”“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud. “Play the game out.”Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost surethat Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into awatchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things abouther had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever liftit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voicehad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. Shethrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if shedespised them for having been won of me.“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham. “Let me think.”I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when shechecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of herright hand.“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing ofweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?”“Yes, ma’am.”“Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let himroam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.”I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and shestood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the sideentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it mustnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confoundedme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strangeroom many hours.“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared andclosed the door.I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at mycoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories wasnot favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled menow, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had evertaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be calledknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, andthen I should have been so too.She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. Sheput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread andmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog indisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—Icannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its namewas,—that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, thegirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause ofthem. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, shegave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having madetoo sure that I was so wounded—and left me.But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my facein, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned mysleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; sobitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,that needed counteraction.My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world inwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there isnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may beonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child issmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as manyhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Withinmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict withinjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that mysister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I hadcherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gaveher no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I hadnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in asolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I wasmorally timid and very sensitive.I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into thebrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed myface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meatwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soonin spirits to look about me.To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in thebrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some highwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if therehad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were nopigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copperor the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might haveevaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was awilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance ofbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted asa sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I rememberthose recluses as being like most others.Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an oldwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enoughto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of thehouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there wasa track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimeswalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. Butshe seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptationpresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walkingon them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and neverlooked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the breweryitself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they usedto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When Ifirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near thedoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, andascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,as if she were going out into the sky.It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happenedto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it astranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes—a little dimmed bylooking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a lownook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figurehanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but oneshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the fadedtrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face wasMiss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as ifshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, andin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a momentbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terrorwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight ofpeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the revivinginfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would havebrought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myselfas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, tolet me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, Ithought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced thatmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened thegate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,when she touched me with a taunting hand.“Why don’t you cry?”“Because I don’t want to.”“You do,” said she. “You have been crying till you are half blind, andyou are near crying again now.”She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved tofind him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day Iwas wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk toour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeplyrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit ofcalling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I hadconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-livedbad way.Chapter IX.When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about MissHavisham’s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myselfgetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and thesmall of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against thekitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficientlength.If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of otheryoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hiddenin mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason tosuspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to manyreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s asmy eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but Ifelt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; andalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained animpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in mydragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) beforethe contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as Icould, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon bya devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, camegaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the detailsdivulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyesand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoatheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in thechair of honour by the fire. “How did you get on up town?”I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated. “Pretty well is no answer.Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacyperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, myobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answeredas if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—Ihad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr.Pumblechook interposed with “No! Don’t lose your temper. Leave this ladto me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned metowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” andfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which wassomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through mypence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pencemake three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he haddone for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which Ireplied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I wasso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, andsaid, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, forinstance?”“Yes!” said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it washighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, andbrought him to a dead stop.“Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began again when hehad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying thescrew.“Very tall and dark,” I told him.“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that hehad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (“This is the way to havehim! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; youknow so well how to deal with him.”“Now, boy! What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr.Pumblechook.“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they wellmight—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”“Yes,” said I. “And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed herin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all hadcake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eatmine, because she told me to.”“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.“Four dogs,” said I.“Large or small?”“Immense,” said I. “And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silverbasket.”Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utteramazement. I was perfectly frantic,—a reckless witness under thetorture,—and would have told them anything.“Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.“In Miss Havisham’s room.” They stared again. “But there weren’t anyhorses to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejectingfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts ofharnessing.“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe. “What can the boy mean?”“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it’s asedan-chair. She’s flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flightyenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.“How could I,” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I never seeher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!”“Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?”“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I havebeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and thedoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don’t say youdon’t know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What didyou play at, boy?”“We played with flags,” I said. (I beg to observe that I think ofmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)“Flags!” echoed my sister.“Yes,” said I. “Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, andMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, outat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”“Swords!” repeated my sister. “Where did you get swords from?”“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—andpills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted upwith candles.”“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. “That’s thestate of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.” And then they bothstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on mycountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trouserswith my right hand.If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly havebetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning thatthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statementbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bearin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing themarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that Iescaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work tohave a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her ownmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretendedexperiences.Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round thekitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but onlyas regarded him,—not in the least as regarded the other two. TowardsJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they satdebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’sacquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “dosomething” for me; their doubts related to the form that somethingwould take. My sister stood out for “property.” Mr. Pumblechook was infavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteeltrade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into thedeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that Imight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for theveal-cutlets. “If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions thanthat,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had bettergo and do it.” So he went.After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washingup, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he haddone for the night. Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, Ishould like to tell you something.”“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.“Then tell us. What is it, Pip?”“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twistingit between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about MissHavisham’s?”“Remember?” said Joe. “I believe you! Wonderful!”“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatestamazement. “You don’t mean to say it’s—”“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”“But not all of it? Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there wasno black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head. “But at leastthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if therewarn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”“No, Joe.”“A dog?” said Joe. “A puppy? Come?”“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.“Pip, old chap! This won’t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expectto go to?”“It’s terrible, Joe; ain’t it?”“Terrible?” cried Joe. “Awful! What possessed you?”“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirtsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;“but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and Iwish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t beenable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude tome, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’swho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and thatI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that thelies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t know how.This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to dealwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region ofmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after somerumination, “namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn’tought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round tothe same. Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip. _That_ ain’t the way toget out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don’t makeit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You’re oncommonsmall. Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.”“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I’veseen letters—Ah! and from gentlefolks!—that I’ll swear weren’t wrote inprint,” said Joe.“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It’s onlythat.”“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a commonscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king uponhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can’t sit and write his acts ofParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromotedPrince, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the headthat was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.And _I_ know what that is to do, though I can’t say I’ve exactly doneit.”There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouragedme.“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe,reflectively, “mightn’t be the better of continuing for to keep companywith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommonones,—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”“No, Joe.”“(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be ormightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without puttingyour sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of asbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by atrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can’t get tobe oncommon through going straight, you’ll never get to do it throughgoing crooked. So don’t tell no more on ’em, Pip, and live well and diehappy.”“You are not angry with me, Joe?”“No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay ofa stunning and outdacious sort,—alluding to them which bordered onweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,—a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.That’s all, old chap, and don’t never do it no more.”When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forgetJoe’s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed andunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how commonEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, andhow coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sittingin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and howMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far abovethe level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I “usedto do” when I was at Miss Havisham’s; as though I had been there weeksor months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subjectof remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But itis the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who readthis, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, ofthorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for theformation of the first link on one memorable day.Chapter X.The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was toget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminousconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’sgreat-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing toget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if shewould impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obligingof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out herpromise within five minutes.The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-auntmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples andput straws down one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s great-auntcollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them witha birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from handto hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and alittle spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as thisvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state ofcoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupilsthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on thesubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread thehardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made arush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if theyhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), moreillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I havesince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having variousspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This partof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats betweenBiddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gaveout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—orwhat we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, orreverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din hadlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt,who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This wasunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged intothe air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark thatthere was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself witha slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was noteasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account ofthe little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which wasalso Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bedchamber—being butfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candleand no snuffers.It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, underthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that veryevening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting someinformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head ofmoist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English Dwhich she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which Isupposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joeliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict ordersfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, thatevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To theThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalkscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me tobe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, andhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about ourcountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning itto account.It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly atthese records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, Imerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at theend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, andwhere Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and astranger. Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and themoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head wasall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he weretaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in hismouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke awayand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then henodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sitdown there.But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place ofresort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe madefor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me againwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, asit struck me.“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was ablacksmith.”“Yes. I said it, you know,” said Joe.“What’ll you drink, Mr.—? You didn’t mention your name, by the bye.”Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. “What’llyou drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?”“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit ofdrinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”“Habit? No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on aSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe. “Rum.”“Rum,” repeated the stranger. “And will the other gentleman originate asentiment.”“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle.“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. “Glassesround!”“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,“is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk atchurch.”“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. “Thelonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”“That’s it,” said Joe.The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put hislegs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flappingbroad-brimmed traveller’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied overhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As helooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by ahalf-laugh, come into his face.“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems asolitary country towards the river.”“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe.“No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, orvagrants of any sort, out there?”“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don’tfind _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;but not warmly.“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.“Once,” returned Joe. “Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn’t us,Pip?”“Yes, Joe.”The stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he wereexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, “He’s alikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?”“Pip,” said Joe.“Christened Pip?”“No, not christened Pip.”“Surname Pip?”“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of family name what he gave himself when ainfant, and is called by.”“Son of yours?”“Well,” said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be inanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way atthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that wasdiscussed over pipes,—“well—no. No, he ain’t.”“Nevvy?” said the strange man.“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “heis not—no, not to deceive you, he is _not_—my nevvy.”“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger. Which appeared to meto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all aboutrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what femalerelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me andJoe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a mostterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed tothink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, “—asthe poet says.”And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, heconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair andpoke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standingwho visited at our house should always have put me through the sameinflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call tomind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in oursocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some suchophthalmic steps to patronise me.All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked atme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring medown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made hisshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and waspointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly atme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred itand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with afile_.He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done ithe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe’sfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw theinstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined onhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principallyabout turnips.There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pausebefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer onSaturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and waterrunning out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man. “I think I’vegot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, theboy shall have it.”He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in somecrumpled paper, and gave it to me. “Yours!” said he. “Mind! Your own.”I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a lookwith his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders maybe done with an eye by hiding it.On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk musthave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door ofthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wideopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in amanner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and oldacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves inthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance totell her about the bright shilling. “A bad un, I’ll be bound,” saidMrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to the boy! Let’slook at it.”I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. “But what’sthis?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up thepaper. “Two One-Pound notes?”Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed tohave been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-marketsin the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to theJolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I satdown on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling prettysure that the man would not be there.Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them undersome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press inthe state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many andmany a night and day.I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of thestrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of theguiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms ofconspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I hadpreviously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessedme that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxedmyself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and inmy sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing whoheld it, and I screamed myself awake.Chapter XI.At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitatingring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me,as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passagewhere her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had thecandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliouslysaying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite anotherpart of the house.The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole squarebasement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down andopened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in asmall paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by adetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to themanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in theouter wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, andlike Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with alow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company inthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You are to go andstand there boy, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, Icrossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state ofmind, looking out.It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of theneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-treethat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a newgrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different colour, as ifthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. Thiswas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had beensome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit ofgarden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at thewindow, as if it pelted me for coming there.I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and thatits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the roomexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened inall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I hadbeen standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to methat they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretendednot to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because theadmission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out tobe a toady and humbug.They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure,and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly torepress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much remindedme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as Ifound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she hadany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of herface.“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite mysister’s. “Nobody’s enemy but his own!”“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” saidthe gentleman; “far more natural.”“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love ourneighbour.”“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his ownneighbour, who is?”Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),“The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good ideatoo. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely andemphatically, “_Very_ true!”“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all beenlooking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange! Would anyonebelieve that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be induced tosee the importance of the children’s having the deepest of trimmings totheir mourning? ‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify solong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’ So like Matthew!The idea!”“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond; “Heavenforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he neverwill have, any sense of the proprieties.”“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla,—“I was obliged to be firm. Isaid, ‘It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.’ I told him that,without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it frombreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung outin his violent way, and said, with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’ ThankGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantlywent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”“_He_ paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella.“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returnedCamilla. “_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,when I wake up in the night.”The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry orcall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted theconversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my turninground, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I wentout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure! What next!” and Camillaadd, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy! The i-d_e_-a!”As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estellastopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her tauntingmanner, with her face quite close to mine,—“Well?”“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.“Am I pretty?”“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”“Am I insulting?”“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.“Not so much so?”“No.”She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my facewith such force as she had, when I answered it.“Now?” said she. “You little coarse monster, what do you think of menow?”“I shall not tell you.”“Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?”“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I. Which was, I suppose,as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying forher then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were goingup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.“A boy,” said Estella.He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with anexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chinin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by thelight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood upbristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and weredisagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, andstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if hehad let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresightthen, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I hadthis opportunity of observing him well.“Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?” said he.“Yes, sir,” said I.“How do _you_ come here?”“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained.“Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, andyou’re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!” said he, biting the side of hisgreat forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”With those words, he released me—which I was glad of, for his handsmelt of scented soap—and went his way downstairs. I wondered whetherhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or hewould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not muchtime to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room,where she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estellaleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havishamcast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised: “the days haveworn away, have they?”“Yes, ma’am. To-day is—”“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers. “Idon’t want to know. Are you ready to play?”I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am, ma’am.”“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look.“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss Havisham,impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able tofind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the doorbehind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it hadan airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled inthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out thanto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemedcolder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist. Certain wintrybranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted thechamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled itsdarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, butevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, anddropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with atablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when thehouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-pieceof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavilyoverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember itsseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders withblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if somecircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired inthe spider community.I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the sameoccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetlestook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in aponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard ofhearing, and not on terms with one another.These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watchingthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,and she looked like the Witch of the place.“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is whereI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.”With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then andthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxworkat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with herstick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”“It’s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!”She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come!Walk me, walk me!”I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk MissHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, andshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might havebeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, shetwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me tobelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After awhile she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the landing and roaredthat name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her lightappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again roundand round the room.If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I shouldhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her thethree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn’t knowwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havishamtwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,—with a shame-facedconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket. “How well you look!”“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham. “I am yellow skin and bone.”Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and shemurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, “Poor dearsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!”“And how are _you_?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close toCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only MissHavisham wouldn’t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highlyobnoxious to Camilla.“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can beexpected.”“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with exceedingsharpness.“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla. “I don’t wish to make adisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more inthe night than I am quite equal to.”“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while ahitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. “Raymond is awitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokingsand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think withanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure Iwish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night—Theidea!” Here, a burst of tears.The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, andhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at thispoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Camilla, mydear, it is well known that your family feelings are graduallyundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter thanthe other.”“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard butonce, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon thatperson, my dear.”Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugatedold woman, with a small face that might have been made ofwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers,supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady.“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket.“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared torise from her legs to her bosom. “It’s all very true! It’s a weaknessto be so affectionate, but I can’t help it. No doubt my health would bemuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my dispositionif I could. It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation toknow I posses it, when I wake up in the night.” Here another burst offeeling.Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept goinground and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of thevisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla. “Never mixing with any natural ties,never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofawith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with myhead over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don’t knowwhere—”(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account ofMatthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady.“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly viciouspersonage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect tothank you, my love?”“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumedCamilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymondis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the totalinefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-fortetuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have evensupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told—”Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemicalas to the formation of new combinations there.When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me andherself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a greatinfluence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a sudden end.“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham, sternly,“when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,—there,” strikingthe table with her stick, “at my head! And yours will be there! Andyour husband’s there! And Sarah Pocket’s there! And Georgiana’s there!Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feastupon me. And now go!”At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick ina new place. She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again.“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but complyand depart. It’s something to have seen the object of one’s love andduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholysatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could havethat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make adisplay of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one wants tofeast on one’s relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go.The bare idea!”Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heavingbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which Isupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out ofview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. SarahPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah wastoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artfulslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. SarahPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, “Bless you,Miss Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on herwalnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walkedwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last shestopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at itsome seconds,—“This is my birthday, Pip.”I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of. I don’t suffer those who were herejust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, butthey dare not refer to it.”Of course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap ofdecay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on thetable, but not touching it, “was brought here. It and I have worn awaytogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth ofmice have gnawed at me.”She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood lookingat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; theonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a stateto crumble under a touch.“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and whenthey lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table,—which shallbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,—so much thebetter if it is done on this day!”She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her ownfigure lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she tooremained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded inits remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and Imight presently begin to decay.At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in aninstant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why haveyou not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and sat down asbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havishamwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, andmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast andhair.Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that shedid not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yardto be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again leftto wander about as I liked.It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall whichI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that lastoccasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I sawone now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let thevisitors out,—for she had returned with the keys in her hand,—Istrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite awilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth ofweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then aweedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it buta fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismalcorner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning fora moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with apale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared besideme. He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,and I now saw that he was inky.“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to bebest answered by itself, _I_ said, “Halloa!” politely omitting youngfellow.“Who let _you_ in?” said he.“Miss Estella.”“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”“Miss Estella.”“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman.What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the questionsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was soastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under aspell.“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had gonemany paces. “I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There itis!” In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands againstone another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled myhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into mystomach.The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it wasunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, wasparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hitout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha! Wouldyou?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quiteunparalleled within my limited experience.“Laws of the game!” said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on tohis right. “Regular rules!” Here, he skipped from his right leg on tohis left. “Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!” Here,he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while Ilooked helplessly at him.I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I feltmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could havehad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right toconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, Ifollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed bythe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his askingme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, hebegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returnedwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. “Available forboth,” he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell topulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in amanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.Although he did not look very healthy,—having pimples on his face, anda breaking out at his mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalledme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and hehad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. Forthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded forbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably inadvance of the rest of him as to development.My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with everydemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he wereminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedinglyfore-shortened.But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with agreat show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatestsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,looking up at me out of a black eye.His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have nostrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knockeddown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself ordrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction inseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an airand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me atlast. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more Ihit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again andagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his headagainst the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up andturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at thesame time panting out, “That means you have won.”He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed thecontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I goso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species ofsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darklywiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?”and he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and _he_ said“Same to you.”When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept herwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as thoughsomething had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to thegate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.“Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.”I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gonethrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss wasgiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, andthat it was worth nothing.What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what withthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home thelight on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleamingagainst a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path offire across the road.Chapter XII.My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentlemanon his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, themore certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I feltthat the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Lawwould avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties Ihad incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not gostalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks andpitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselvesopen to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution andtrepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the CountyJail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman’s nose had stainedmy trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in thedead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’steeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as Idevised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstancewhen I should be haled before the Judges.When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed ofviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons ofJustice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambushbehind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personalvengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in thosegrave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whethersuborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fallupon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was hightestimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,that I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; theyalways came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with thefamily features.However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did. And behold!nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. Ifound the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked inat the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stoppedby the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the cornerwhere the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of theyoung gentleman’s existence. There were traces of his gore in thatspot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that otherroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—alight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placedthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regularoccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tiredof walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, andacross the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and overagain, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last aslong as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a generalmention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settledthat I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or tenmonths.As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked moreto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was Igoing to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, Ibelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to knoweverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards thatdesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefermy being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anythingbut my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for myservices.Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never toldme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quitefamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that shehated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when wewere alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?” And when I saidyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, whenwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relishof Estella’s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moodswere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzledwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavishfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break theirhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of whichthe burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way ofrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood inthat relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measureof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for theintroduction of Old Clem’s respected name. Thus, you were to hammerboys round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat it out,beat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow thefire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenlysaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There,there, there! Sing!” I was surprised into crooning this ditty as Ipushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that shetook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was sosubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise inthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.What could I become with these surroundings? How could my characterfail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughtswere dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural lightfrom the misty yellow rooms?Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I hadnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which Ihad confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardlyfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passengerto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing ofhim. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estelladiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much morepotent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one butBiddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me todo so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I didnot know then, though I think I know now.Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almostinsupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose ofdiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (tothis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if thesehands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they wouldhave done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity ofmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me beforehim,—as it were, to operate upon,—and he would drag me up from my stool(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting mebefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,“Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up byhand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them whichso did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!” And then he wouldrumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, asalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of anyfellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before him by the sleeve,—aspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculationsabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, flyat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sisterspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out atevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect ofmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that hewas not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully oldenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker onhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, mysister would so distinctly construe that innocent action intoopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker outof his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritatingend to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing tolead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catchingsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come!there’s enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_’ve given troubleenough for one night, I hope!” As if I had besought them as a favour tobother my life out.We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that weshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day MissHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on myshoulder; and said with some displeasure,—“You are growing tall, Pip!”I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had nocontrol.She said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked atme again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning andmoody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise wasover, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with amovement of her impatient fingers:—“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”“Joe Gargery, ma’am.”“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”“Yes, Miss Havisham.”“You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here withyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?”I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to beasked.“Then let him come.”“At any particular time, Miss Havisham?”“There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and comealong with you.”When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister“went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previousperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-matsunder our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company wegraciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrentof such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loudsobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put onher coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Notsatisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in theback-yard. It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep inagain, and then she asked Joe why he hadn’t married a Negress Slave atonce? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whiskerand looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might havebeen a better speculation.Chapter XIII.It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joearraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to MissHavisham’s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to theoccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better inhis working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself sodreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was forme he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made thehair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to townwith us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook’s and called for “when wehad done with our fine ladies”—a way of putting the case, from whichJoe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for theday, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom todo on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllableHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in thedirection he had taken.We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaverbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaitedStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it wasa fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles werecarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they weredisplayed as articles of property,—much as Cleopatra or any othersovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant orprocession.When we came to Pumblechook’s, my sister bounced in and left us. As itwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham’s house.Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joetook his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands;as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular tohalf a quarter of an ounce.Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knewso well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked backat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with thegreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips ofhis toes.Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuffand conducted him into Miss Havisham’s presence. She was seated at herdressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.“Oh!” said she to Joe. “You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself orso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, withhis tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted aworm.“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister of thisboy?”It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persistedin addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was atonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and greatpoliteness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the timewhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”“Well!” said Miss Havisham. “And you have reared the boy, with theintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?”“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends, and itwere looked for’ard to betwixt us, as being calc’lated to lead tolarks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to thebusiness,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—notbut what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection? Does helike the trade?”“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe,strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, andpoliteness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the ideasuddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to theoccasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren’t no objection onyour part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that heought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures tohim to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, hepersisted in being to Me.“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss Havisham.“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a littleunreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore youknow as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave them, notto Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear goodfellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood atthe back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughedmischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them toMiss Havisham.“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “nopremium with the boy?”“Joe!” I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. “Why don’t youanswer—”“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which Imeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourselfand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know itto be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really wasbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and tookup a little bag from the table beside her.“Pip has earned a premium here,” she said, “and here it is. There arefive-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.”As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened inhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,persisted in addressing me.“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as suchreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,nor nowheres. And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me asensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if thatfamiliar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—“and now, old chap,may we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one andanother, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—forthe satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Joe showed that hefelt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantlyrescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” Thesewords had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said themtwice.“Good-bye, Pip!” said Miss Havisham. “Let them out, Estella.”“Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?” I asked.“No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!”Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joein a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here, andthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect noother and no more.”How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but Iknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairsinstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I wentafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside thegate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in thedaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,“Astonishing!” And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” atintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never comingback. At length he prolonged his remark into “Pip, I do assure _you_this is as-TON-ishing!” and so, by degrees, became conversational andable to walk away.I have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by theencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’she invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in whattook place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on our presentingourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once. “And what’shappened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poorsociety as this, I am sure I do!”“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort ofremembrance, “made it wery partick’ler that we should give her—were itcompliments or respects, Pip?”“Compliments,” I said.“Which that were my own belief,” answered Joe; “her compliments to Mrs.J. Gargery—”“Much good they’ll do me!” observed my sister; but rather gratifiedtoo.“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like anothereffort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham’s elth weresitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”“Of her having the pleasure,” I added.“Of ladies’ company,” said Joe. And drew a long breath.“Well!” cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.“She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, butit’s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipolehere?”“She giv’ him,” said Joe, “nothing.”Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.“What she giv’,” said Joe, “she giv’ to his friends. ‘And by hisfriends,’ were her explanation, ‘I mean into the hands of his sisterMrs. J. Gargery.’ Them were her words; ‘Mrs. J. Gargery.’ She mayn’thave know’d,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, “whether itwere Joe, or Jorge.”My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his woodenarm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known allabout it beforehand.“And how much have you got?” asked my sister, laughing. Positivelylaughing!“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe.“They’d say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well. Not too much,but pretty well.”“It’s more than that, then,” said Joe.That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as herubbed the arms of his chair, “It’s more than that, Mum.”“Why, you don’t mean to say—” began my sister.“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Goodin you! Go on!”“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty pound?”“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister.“Well, then,” said Joe, “It’s more than twenty pound.”That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with apatronizing laugh, “It’s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow herup, Joseph!”“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag tomy sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”“It’s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers,Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it’s no more thanyour merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joyof the money!”If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficientlyawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me intocustody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminalityfar behind.“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me by thearm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right throughwith what they’ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That’s_my_ way. Bound out of hand.”“Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,” said my sister (grasping themoney), “we’re deeply beholden to you.”“Never mind me, Mum,” returned that diabolical cornchandler. “Apleasure’s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; wemust have him bound. I said I’d see to it—to tell you the truth.”The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at oncewent over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterialpresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been takenred-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,I heard some people say, “What’s he done?” and others, “He’s a young’un, too, but looks bad, don’t he?” One person of mild and benevolentaspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolentyoung man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, andentitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than achurch,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and withmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, withfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or readingthe newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls,which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake andsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed andattested, and I was “bound”; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the whileas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those littlepreliminaries disposed of.When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had beenput into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publiclytortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends weremerely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook’s. And there mysister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing wouldserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the BlueBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bringthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, itinscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the wholecompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make itworse, they all asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they hadnothing else to do,—why I didn’t enjoy myself? And what could Ipossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,—when I wasn’t!However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made themost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficentcontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and hadfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if Iplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appearedto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chairbeside him to illustrate his remarks.My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That theywouldn’t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,woke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in theevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins’s ode, and threw his bloodstainedsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in andsaid, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and itwasn’t the Tumblers’ Arms.” That, they were all in excellent spirits onthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, andasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitivebore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, bywanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that _he_ wasthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the wholethe weakest pilgrim going.Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was trulywretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never likeJoe’s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.Chapter XIV.It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may beblack ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributiveand well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister’stemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I hadbelieved in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believedin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whosesolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I hadbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; Ihad believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood andindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was allcoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estellasee it on any account.How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,how much Miss Havisham’s, how much my sister’s, is now of no moment tome or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Wellor ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up myshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe’s ’prentice, I should bedistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only feltthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weightupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There havebeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when Ihave felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all itsinterest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull enduranceany more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when myway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newlyentered road of apprenticeship to Joe.I remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand aboutthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing myown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likenessbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on boththere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quiteas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in thatafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joewhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I _am_ glad toknow of myself in that connection.For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what Iproceed to add was Joe’s. It was not because I was faithful, butbecause Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldieror a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue ofindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possibleto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doingman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how ithas touched one’s self in going by, and I know right well that any goodthat intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contentedJoe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.What I wanted, who can say? How can _I_ say, when I never knew? What Idreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest andcommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one ofthe wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that shewould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doingthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we weresinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at MissHavisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with herpretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often atsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in thewall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw herjust drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come atlast.After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal wouldhave a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed ofhome than ever, in my own ungracious breast.Chapter XV.As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, myeducation under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however,until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the littlecatalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for ahalf-penny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece ofliterature were the opening lines,     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,     Too rul loo rul     Too rul loo rul     Wasn’t I done very brown sirs?     Too rul loo rul     Too rul loo rul—still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart withthe utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit,except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat inexcess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals toMr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which hekindly complied. As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me fora dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept overand bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety ofways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr.Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds sowell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wantedto make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of mysociety and less open to Estella’s reproach.The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a brokenslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educationalimplements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knewJoe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire,under my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smokehis pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhereelse,—even with a learned air,—as if he considered himself to beadvancing immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the riverpassing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low,looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing onat the bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing outto sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of MissHavisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off,upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just thesame.—Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strangelife appeared to have something to do with everything that waspicturesque.One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himselfon being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I layon the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descryingtraces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the skyand in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thoughtconcerning them that had been much in my head.“Joe,” said I; “don’t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?”“Well, Pip,” returned Joe, slowly considering. “What for?”“What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?”“There is some wisits p’r’aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open tothe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She mightthink you wanted something,—expected something of her.”“Don’t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?”“You might, old chap,” said Joe. “And she might credit it. Similarlyshe mightn’t.”Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hardat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.“You see, Pip,” Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, “MissHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done thehandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that wereall.”“Yes, Joe. I heard her.”“ALL,” Joe repeated, very emphatically.“Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.”“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,—Make a endon it!—As you was!—Me to the North, and you to the South!—Keep insunders!”I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me tofind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it moreprobable.“But, Joe.”“Yes, old chap.”“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the dayof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked afterher, or shown that I remember her.”“That’s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoesall four round,—and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all fourround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy ofhoofs—”“I don’t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don’t mean a present.”But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp uponit. “Or even,” said he, “if you was helped to knocking her up a newchain for the front door,—or say a gross or two of shark-headed screwsfor general use,—or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-forkwhen she took her muffins,—or a gridiron when she took a sprat or suchlike—”“I don’t mean any present at all, Joe,” I interposed.“Well,” said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularlypressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn’t. No, I would _not_. Forwhat’s a door-chain when she’s got one always up? And shark-headers isopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you’d gointo brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can’tshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,—for a gridiron IS a gridiron,”said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouringto rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like,but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again yourleave, and you can’t help yourself—”“My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, “don’tgo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham anypresent.”“No, Pip,” Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, allalong; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slackjust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think Iwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est—Havisham.”“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain’t Estavisham, Pip, unless shehave been rechris’ened.”“I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,Joe?”In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well ofit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not receivedwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as avisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude fora favour received, then this experimental trip should have nosuccessor. By these conditions I promised to abide.Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. Hepretended that his Christian name was Dolge,—a clear Impossibility,—buthe was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him tohave been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully tohave imposed that name upon the village as an affront to itsunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow ofgreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never evenseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if bymere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat hisdinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or theWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intentionof ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes,and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with hishands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round hisneck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on thesluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted orotherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that itwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small andtimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black cornerof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it wasnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,and that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe’s ’prentice,Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displacehim; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that healways beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang OldClem, he came in out of time.Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe ofmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had justgot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but byand by he said, leaning on his hammer,—“Now, master! Sure you’re not a-going to favour only one of us. IfYoung Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose hewas about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as anancient person.“Why, what’ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Joe.“What’ll _I_ do with it! What’ll _he_ do with it? I’ll do as much withit as _him_,” said Orlick.“As to Pip, he’s going up town,” said Joe.“Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_’s a-going up town,” retorted thatworthy. “Two can go up town. Tain’t only one wot can go up town.“Don’t lose your temper,” said Joe.“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick. “Some and their uptowning! Now,master! Come. No favouring in this shop. Be a man!”The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman wasin a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hotbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,—as ifit were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,—andfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, andhe again leaned on his hammer,—“Now, master!”“Are you all right now?” demanded Joe.“Ah! I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick.“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,” saidJoe, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,—she wasa most unscrupulous spy and listener,—and she instantly looked in atone of the windows.“Like you, you fool!” said she to Joe, “giving holidays to great idlehulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages inthat way. I wish _I_ was his master!”“You’d be everybody’s master, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with anill-favoured grin.(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)“I’d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,” returned my sister,beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. “And I couldn’t be amatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who’s thedunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn’t be a match for therogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking andthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!”“You’re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,” growled the journeyman. “If thatmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good’un.”(“Let her alone, will you?” said Joe.)“What did you say?” cried my sister, beginning to scream. “What did yousay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,with my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!” Each of these exclamationswas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true ofall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse forher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, sheconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herselfinto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was thename he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Holdme! Oh!”“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I’d hold you, ifyou was my wife. I’d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.”(“I tell you, let her alone,” said Joe.)“Oh! To hear him!” cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and ascream together,—which was her next stage. “To hear the names he’sgiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With myhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!” Here my sister, after a fit of clappingsand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, andthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,—which were the last stageson her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a completesuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parentheticalinterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what hemeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whetherhe was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situationadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defencestraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burntaprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man inthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.Orlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale younggentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to comeout of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who haddropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, Ithink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who wasrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench herhands in Joe’s hair. Then came that singular calm and silence whichsucceed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I havealways connected with such a lull,—namely, that it was Sunday, andsomebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself.[Illustration]When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without anyother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick’s nostrils,which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appearedfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in apeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influenceon Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a partingobservation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off theRampage, Pip:—such is Life!”With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are veryserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going toMiss Havisham’s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassedthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how Idebated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I shouldundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.“How, then? You here again?” said Miss Pocket. “What do you want?”When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarahevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about mybusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.“Well?” said she, fixing her eyes upon me. “I hope you want nothing?You’ll get nothing.”“No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doingvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.”“There, there!” with the old restless fingers. “Come now and then; comeon your birthday.—Ay!” she cried suddenly, turning herself and herchair towards me, “You are looking round for Estella? Hey?”I had been looking round,—in fact, for Estella,—and I stammered that Ihoped she was well.“Abroad,” said Miss Havisham; “educating for a lady; far out of reach;prettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that youhave lost her?”There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the lastwords, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at aloss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, bydismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of thewalnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with myhome and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by_that_ motion.As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately atthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had inhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had thatmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it onthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No soonerdid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providencehad put a ’prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As Iknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and theway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was betterthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned intoPumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, Idon’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that ittook until half-past nine o’ clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopslegot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, hebecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgracefulcareer. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of beingcut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running toseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, wasa mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was theidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. WhenBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positivelyapologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,too, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious andmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuatingcircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on everyoccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care abutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinatingconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the generalfeebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopslehad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking hishead, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were awell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, providedI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out withMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,and it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out ofthe lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substanceon the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rosewith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when wecame upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick there?”“Ah!” he answered, slouching out. “I was standing by a minute, on thechance of company.”“You are late,” I remarked.Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well? And _you_’re late.”“We have been,” said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,—“wehave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we allwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spendinghis half-holiday up and down town?“Yes,” said he, “all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn’t seeyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the gunsis going again.”“At the Hulks?” said I.“Ay! There’s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have beengoing since dark, about. You’ll hear one presently.”In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when thewell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavilyrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuingand threatening the fugitives.“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick. “We’d be puzzled how tobring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it insilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’stragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was verydark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, thesound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolledsulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and mythoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly gameon Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlicksometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out,—Old Clem! With a clinkfor the stout,—Old Clem!” I thought he had been drinking, but he wasnot drunk.Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took uspast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it beingeleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, andunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scatteredabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising thata convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at yourplace, Pip. Run all!”“What is it?” I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.“I can’t quite understand. The house seems to have been violentlyentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody hasbeen attacked and hurt.”We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made nostop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the wholevillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and therewas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midstof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,and so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement onthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow onthe back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face wasturned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again,while she was the wife of Joe.Chapter XVI.With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed tobelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be underobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion thanany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I beganto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on allsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from aquarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he wasthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and hadexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could notbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got intodense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have beenbefore nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he foundher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. Thefire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candlevery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyondthe blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the doorand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire andwas struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting suchas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was oneremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck withsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows weredealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerableviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, whenJoe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filedasunder.Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to havebeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to theHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion wascorroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left theprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but theyclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not beenworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,one of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of hisiron.Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believedthe iron to be my convict’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard himfiling at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having putit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to havebecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when wepicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all theevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, andhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing againsthim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and witheverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; ifhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been nodispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restorethem. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come inso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she couldlook round.It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, howeverundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I sufferedunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether Ishould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all thestory. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finallyin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. Thecontention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old onenow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could nottear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so muchmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from meif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would notbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutletsas a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, ofcourse—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thingis always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should seeany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery ofthe assailant.The Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened inthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house fora week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of likeauthorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviouslywrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, insteadof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stoodabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looksthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had amysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good astaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister layvery ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objectsmultiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead ofthe realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; andher speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far asto be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate alwaysby her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicatein speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more thanindifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,extraordinary complications arose between them which I was alwayscalled in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were amongthe mildest of my own mistakes.However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. Atremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a partof her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or threemonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would thenremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. Wewere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until acircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle’sgreat-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she hadfallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.It may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in thekitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing thewhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadlycut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and hadbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to meevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a finefigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking thecleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joebecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change thatdid him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they hadall more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and thatthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepestspirits they had ever encountered.Biddy’s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty thathad completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had madenothing of it. Thus it was:—Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, acharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmosteagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularlywanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that thesign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in mysister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed aqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, oneafter another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, theshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, anddisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shookher head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrifiedlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, thismysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully atit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, lookedthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by hisinitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face. “Don’t you see?It’s _him_!”Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signifyhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into thekitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with hisarm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that stronglydistinguished him.I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I wasdisappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatestanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by hisbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him givensomething to drink. She watched his countenance as if she wereparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to hisreception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, andthere was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I haveseen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After thatday, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate,and without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, asif he knew no more than I did what to make of it.Chapter XVII.I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which wasvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no moreremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my payinganother visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on dutyat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and shespoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when Iwas going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mentionat once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline takingthe guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect thancausing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and afterthat, I took it.So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkenedroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, thatI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in thatmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grewolder, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to mythoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hatemy trade and to be ashamed of home.Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Hershoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her handswere always clean. She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could notbe like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.She had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newlyout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myselfone evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyesthat were very pretty and very good.It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poringat—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways atonce by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I wasabout. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework withoutlaying it down.“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or youare very clever.”“What is it that I manage? I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling.She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did notmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn,and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of myknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside thegreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I haveno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how _you_ manage?”“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can seeme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and wenton with her sewing.Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked atBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think herrather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she wasequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of ourdifferent sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever Iknew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmithas I, or better.“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of everychance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see howimproved you are!”Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. “I wasyour first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed.“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement. “Why, you are crying!”“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing. “What put that inyour head?”What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as itdropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had beenuntil Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit ofliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in themiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged andshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there musthave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my firstuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter ofcourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while Ilooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhapsI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been tooreserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not usethat precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were myfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever beingtogether like this, in this kitchen.”“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness totransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,making her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have aquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertookthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went outtogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passedthe village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on themarshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, Ibegan to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in myusual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than itwould have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good timeand place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be agentleman.”“O, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned. “I don’t think it wouldanswer.”“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons forwanting to be a gentleman.”“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you are?”“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am. I amdisgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken toeither, since I was bound. Don’t be absurd.”“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorryfor that; I didn’t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to becomfortable.”“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can becomfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead avery different sort of life from the life I lead now.”“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kindof quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was halfinclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gaveutterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and Iknew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the shortgrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelingsout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could havesettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I waslittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joewould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gonepartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up tokeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on afine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for_you_; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned foranswer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely soundedflattering, but I knew she meant well.“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a bladeor two, “see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody hadtold me so!”Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far moreattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” sheremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. “Who said it?”I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where Iwas going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and Ianswered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s morebeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and Iwant to be a gentleman on her account.” Having made this lunaticconfession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if Ihad some thoughts of following it.“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?”Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—butyou know best—that might be better and more independently done bycaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I shouldthink—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what wasperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazedvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best andwisest of men fall every day?“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire herdreadfully.”In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a goodgrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. Allthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad andmisplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my faceright, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against thepebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened bywork, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of myhair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while withmy face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in thebrewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-usedby somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say which.“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have feltyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping itand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such apoor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been yourteacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she wouldset. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,and it’s of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose fromthe bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shallwe walk a little farther, or go home?”“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and givingher a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy.“You know I never shall be, so that’s always. Not that I have anyoccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as Itold you at home the other night.”“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, “shall we walk alittle farther, or go home?”I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and thesummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was verybeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally andwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playingbeggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stoppedclocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very goodfor me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of thoseremembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relishwhat I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I askedmyself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella werebeside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I saidto myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemedright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day andsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and nopleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded herown breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like hermuch the better of the two?“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could putme right.”“I wish I could!” said Biddy.“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you don’t mind myspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy. “Don’t mind me.”“If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing forme.”“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it wouldhave done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I thereforeobserved I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she _was_, andshe said it decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yetI took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, andget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate,or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnantway), Old Orlick.“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”“Where should we be going, but home?”“Well, then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case ofhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,but used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,and convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, hewould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,“Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.” As I did not like him either, Itook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn’t wantseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell oflaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a littledistance.Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand inthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to giveany account, I asked her why she did not like him.“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,“because I—I am afraid he likes me.”“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly.“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told meso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did notdoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed uponOld Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage onmyself.“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I don’tapprove of it.”“Nor I neither,” said Biddy. “Though _that_ makes no difference toyou.”“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion ofyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstanceswere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure thatdemonstration. He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason ofmy sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get himdismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, asI had reason to know thereafter.And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicatedits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when Iwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that theplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to beashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect andhappiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that mydisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I wasgrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep companywith Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of theHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, andscatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; andoften before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed inall directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all MissHavisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of myperplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but wasbrought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.Chapter XVIII.It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was aSaturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the ThreeJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.Of that group I was one.A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbruedin blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective inthe description, and identified himself with every witness at theInquest. He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and hebarbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the murderer. He gavethe medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner;and he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heardblows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regardingthe mental competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’shands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyedhimself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfullycomfortable. In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict WilfulMurder.Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaningover the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was anexpression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a greatforefinger as he watched the group of faces.“Well!” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done,“you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He lookedat everybody coldly and sarcastically.“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honour of youracquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this we all took courage to unitein a confirmatory murmur.“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would. I told you so.But now I’ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, thatthe law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he isproved—proved—to be guilty?”“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I—”“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. “Don’t evadethe question. Either you know it, or you don’t know it. Which is it tobe?”He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in abullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.Wopsle,—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again.“Now!” said he. “Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle.“Certainly you know it. Then why didn’t you say so at first? Now, I’llask you another question,”—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if hehad a right to him,—“_do_ you know that none of these witnesses haveyet been cross-examined?”Mr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stoppedhim.“What? You won’t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I’ll try youagain.” Throwing his finger at him again. “Attend to me. Are you aware,or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet beencross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?”Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a pooropinion of him.“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you. You don’t deserve help, butI’ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?”“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspiciousmanner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”“Undoubtedly.”“Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether itdistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legaladvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?”“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you readjust now. You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards, if you like,—and,perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no myfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to thebottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full ofsubterfuge.) “Well? Have you found it?”“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle.“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether itdistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he wasinstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!Do you make that of it?”Mr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman bitterly. “Is that theexact substance?”“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle.“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the companywith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. “And now Iask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with thatpassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after havingpronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thoughthim, and that he was beginning to be found out.“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing hisfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that same man might be summoned as ajuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committedhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head uponhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and trulytry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and theprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to theevidence, so help him God!”We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone toofar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yettime.The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, andwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one ofus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose todisclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the spacebetween the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remainedstanding, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger ofhis right.“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us as weall quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmithamong you, by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery. Which is the man?”“Here is the man,” said Joe.The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip?Is he here?”“I am here!” I cried.The stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as thegentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visitto Miss Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over thesettle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon myshoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his darkcomplexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his largewatch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even thesmell of scented soap on his great hand.“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when hehad surveyed me at his leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps wehad better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate mycommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as youplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strangegentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side ofhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasionas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the frontdoor. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feeblylighted by one candle.It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in hispocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a littleaside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, toascertain which was which.“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I ampretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and Icommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advicehad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and yousee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, Ido. No less, no more.”Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he gotup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thushaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you ofthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel hisindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing forso doing?”“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’sway,” said Joe, staring.“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr.Jaggers. “The question is, Would you want anything? Do you wantanything?”“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a foolfor his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered betweenbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers. “Recollect the admission you have made,and don’t try to go from it presently.”“Who’s a-going to try?” retorted Joe.“I don’t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?”“Yes, I do keep a dog.”“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.Bear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyesand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.“Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have gotto make is, that he has great expectations.”Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing hisfinger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of thatproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere oflife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,—in a word,as a young fellow of great expectations.”My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; MissHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I haveto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request ofthe person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear thename of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your greatexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you haveany objection, this is the time to mention it.”My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.“I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, thatthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains aprofound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empoweredto mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at firsthand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may becarried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now,you are distinctly to understand that you are most positivelyprohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion orreference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_individual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you havea suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibitionare; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be merewhim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down.Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is theonly remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person fromwhom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwiseresponsible. That person is the person from whom you derive yourexpectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such arise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the timeto mention it. Speak out.”Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.“I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, hestill could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; andeven now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me whilehe spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to mydisparagement, if he only chose to mention them. “We come next, to meredetails of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used theterm ‘expectations’ more than once, you are not endowed withexpectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of moneyamply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You willplease consider me your guardian. Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “Itell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn’t renderthem. It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordancewith your altered position, and that you will be alive to theimportance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”I said I had always longed for it.“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he retorted;“keep to the record. If you long for it now, that’s enough. Am Ianswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some propertutor? Is that it?”I stammered yes, that was it.“Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don’t think thatwise, mind, but it’s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whomyou would prefer to another?”I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt;so, I replied in the negative.“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I thinkmight suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I don’t recommend him,observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of isone Mr. Matthew Pocket.”Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham’s relation. TheMatthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whoseplace was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead, in herbride’s dress on the bride’s table.“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and thenshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.My answer was, that I had heard of the name.“Oh!” said he. “You have heard of the name. But the question is, whatdo you say of it?”I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for hisrecommendation—“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head veryslowly. “Recollect yourself!”Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to himfor his recommendation—“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and frowningand smiling both at once,—“no, no, no; it’s very well done, but itwon’t do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is notthe word, Mr. Pip. Try another.”Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for hismention of Mr. Matthew Pocket—“_That_’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers.—And (I added), I wouldgladly try that gentleman.“Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall beprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. Whenwill you come to London?”I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that Isupposed I could come directly.“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to comein, and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You’llwant some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted themout on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time hehad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when hehad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.“Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?”“I _am_!” said Joe, in a very decided manner.“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”“It were understood,” said Joe. “And it are understood. And it everwill be similar according.”“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,—“what if it was in myinstructions to make you a present, as compensation?”“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded.“For the loss of his services.”Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I haveoften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man orpat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. “Pipis that hearty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his services, tohonour and fortun’, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Moneycan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what cometo the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, Isee you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your eyes,and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear goodfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon myarm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel’swing!But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my futurefortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. Ibegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the bestof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyeswith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, butsaid not another word.Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe thevillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:—“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No halfmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it incharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on thecontrary you mean to say—” Here, to his great amazement, he was stoppedby Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fellpugilistic purpose.“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my placebull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech ifyou’re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersayand stand or fall by!”I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating tome, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to anyone whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to bebull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen whenJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing anyinclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictoryremarks. They were these.“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be agentleman—the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shallreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take ahackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight tome. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on thetrust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,understand that, finally. Understand that!”He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have goneon, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as hewas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hiredcarriage.“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to mytaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.“I don’t mean in the village only, but up town?”“No,” said he. “No objection.”I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe hadalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and wasseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently atthe burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at thecoals, and nothing was said for a long time.My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat ather needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat nextJoe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into theglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; thelonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding hisknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended tomake off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”“I would rather you told, Joe.”“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him init!”Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and lookedat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartilycongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in theircongratulations that I rather resented.I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) withthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing andsay nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out ingood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her workagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaininghis knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and thenthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder atthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn’t half like it.Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister someidea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those effortsentirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But Idoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and Icannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddybecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it ispossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfiedwith myself.Anyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, andabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever Icaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and theyoften looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if theywere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never didby word or sign.At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchendoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer eveningsto air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I amafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on therustic objects among which I had passed my life.“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheeseand beer. “Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They’llsoon go.”“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.“They’ll soon go.”“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, andorder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and putthem on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s. Itwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”“Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figuretoo, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheeseon it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supperas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. “So mightWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.”“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe. They would make such a business ofit,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn’t bear myself.”“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe. “If you couldn’t abear yourself—”Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have youthought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sisterand me? You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quickthat it’s difficult to keep up with you.”(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me saythat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likelyon the evening before I go away.”Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged anaffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When Igot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as amean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and evenat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mindbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been inso often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, andthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, Isaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn ortwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe andlight it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to methat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking hispipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knewthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearingtone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened formore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, andsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful andstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be theloneliest I had ever known.Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipefloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—notobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we sharedtogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasybed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.Chapter XIX.Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What layheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervenedbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of amisgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, andthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated orclean gone.Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of ourapproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. Afterbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the bestparlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. Withall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about therich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish offthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, Ifelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassionfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday afterSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among thelow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for themone of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinnerof roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon ofcondescension, upon everybody in the village.If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of mycompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping amongthose graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the placerecalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron andbadge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that hehad doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead tome, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of thesegrazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear amore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they mightstare as long as possible at the possessor of such greatexpectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith’s work ingeneral, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havishamintended me for Estella, fell asleep.When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening myeyes, and said,—“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”“Thankee, Pip.”“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken hands,“that I shall never forget you.”“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “_I_’m sure of that.Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it wellround in a man’s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of timeto get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure ofme. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,“It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I madeno remark on Joe’s first head; merely saying as to his second, that thetidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be agentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if Iwere one.“Have you though?” said Joe. “Astonishing!”“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more,when we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe. “I’m so awful dull. I’m only masterof my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it’sno more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don’t you see?”What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able todo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he hadbeen better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectlyinnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it toBiddy in preference.So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into ourlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in ageneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should neverforget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity ofhelping Joe on, a little.”“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.“Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think he is the dearestfellow that ever lived,—but he is rather backward in some things. Forinstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened hereyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.“O, his manners! won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking ablack-currant leaf.“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”“O! they _do_ very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely atthe leaf in her hand.“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as Ishall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they wouldhardly do him justice.”“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the mostdistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—“Biddy, what do you mean?”Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and thesmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me thatevening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have younever considered that he may be proud?”“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.“O! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me andshaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy. “He may be too proud to let anyone take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fillswell and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though itsounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than Ido.”“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you. I did notexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. Youare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t helpshowing it.”“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so. Say soover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in avirtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me. I am very sorryto see it, and it’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature. I did intend toask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I wasgone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I amextremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated. “It’s a—it’s abad side of human nature.”“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you mayequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, atall times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make nodifference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not beunjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (inwhich sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason tothink I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate andtook a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it verysorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my brightfortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemencyto Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes Ihad, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having hisbreakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think itworth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. “How areyou, and what can I do for you?”Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and wasslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was aprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperouslittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe letinto the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt thatheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.“Mr. Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsomeproperty.”A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got upfrom the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,“Lord bless my soul!”“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing someguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionablesuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise Ithought he might only pretend to make them, “with ready money.”“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, openedhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of eachelbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulateyou? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?”Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened hislabours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out intothe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possiblecorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality withany blacksmith, alive or dead.“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “orI’ll knock your head off!—Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it outin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his handunder it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommendit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But youshall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and witha dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’sbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he haddeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. “And letme have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repentit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferentialconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, anarticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that itwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguishedfellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) havingworn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr.Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop andbring them myself?”I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’sjudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contentedwith it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existingcircumstances, sir,—wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr. Trabb measured andcalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finestspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that Ifelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for hispains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articlesto Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his handupon the parlour lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot beexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me aturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteemit. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!”The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion whatit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with hishands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of moneywas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb’s boy.After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and thebootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’sdog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also wentto the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturdaymorning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had comeinto a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attentiondiverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated hismind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed mysteps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’splace of business, I saw him standing at his door.He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early withthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He hadprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too orderedhis shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed.“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, whenhe and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your goodfortune. Well deserved, well deserved!”This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way ofexpressing himself.“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me forsome moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leadingup to this, is a proud reward.”I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever saidor hinted, on that point.“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook; “if you will allow me tocall you so—”I murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both handsagain, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had anemotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear youngfriend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keepingthe fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!” said Mr. Pumblechook, inthe way of a compassionate adjuration. “Joseph!! Joseph!!!” Thereuponhe shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency inJoseph.“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry,you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from theBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here’s one or twolittle things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.But do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after hehad sat down, “see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times ofhappy infancy? And may I—_may_ I—?”This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he wasfervent, and then sat down again.“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet Icannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—andlikewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—_may_ I—?”I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied hisglass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turnedmyself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone moredirect to my head.Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice oftongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), andtook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. “Ah! poultry,poultry! You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising thefowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in storefor you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath thishumble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr.Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? _may_ I—?”It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so hedid it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himselfwith my knife, I don’t know.“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which hadthe honour of bringing you up by hand! It’s a sad picter, to reflectthat she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May—”I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.“We’ll drink her health,” said I.“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccidwith admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t know whoSir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third personpresent); “that’s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Everforgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook,putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to acommon person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?”When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. “Letus never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of temper, butit is to be hoped she meant well.”At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed inthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothessent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. Imentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, heintimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he? Then heasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how wehad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how hehad ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had takenten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that henever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart ofhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feelingconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was asensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to askmy advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there wasan opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn andseed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurredbefore in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting tothe realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, througha sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing todo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine thebooks,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in hispocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that thatmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined withproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave itas my opinion. “Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness ofthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shakehands with me, but said he really must,—and did.We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over andover again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), andto render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know whatservice). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, andcertainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he hadalways said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’will be no common fortun’.” He said with a tearful smile that it was asingular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went outinto the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwontedin the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously gotto the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me. He was a long waydown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me tostop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.“Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass withoutthat affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?_May_ I?”We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a youngcarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed meand stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in theroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedgebefore I pursued my way home.I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the littleI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing thatsame afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should wantnext morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning Iwent to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit toMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dressin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. Myclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new andeagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell atrifle short of the wearer’s expectation. But after I had had my newsuit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity ofposturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in thefutile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It beingmarket morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.Pumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant toleave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again beforedeparting. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my newarray, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspiciousafter all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’sin his Sunday suit.I went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and rangat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of mygloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back whenshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turnedfrom brown to green and yellow.“You?” said she. “You? Good gracious! What do you want?”“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-byeto Miss Havisham.”I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she wentto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returnedand took me up, staring at me all the way.Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spreadtable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was thenjust abreast of the rotted bride-cake.“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said. “Well, Pip?”“I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedinglycareful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my takingleave of you.”“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick playround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, werebestowing the finishing gift.“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, MissHavisham,” I murmured. “And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!”“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, withdelight. “I have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So yougo to-morrow?”“Yes, Miss Havisham.”“And you are adopted by a rich person?”“Yes, Miss Havisham.”“Not named?”“No, Miss Havisham.”“And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?”“Yes, Miss Havisham.”She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was herenjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay. “Well!” she went on; “youhave a promising career before you. Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.Jaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, andSarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.“Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”“Yes, Miss Havisham.”“Good-bye, Pip!”She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to mylips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it camenaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocketwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, withboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimlylighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seenout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degreeconfounded. I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, anddid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of thehouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my newclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I hadthe bundle to carry.And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had runout fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face moresteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindledaway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and moreappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, Idressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in mysplendour	 until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finishwith. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be inspirits.I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my littlehand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away allalone. I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my senseof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to thecoach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing ofthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room onthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and hadan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me inthe morning. I did not.All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong placesinstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, nowpigs, now men,—never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied meuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up andpartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and intaking it fell asleep.Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did notsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire whenI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in theafternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinkingof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to godownstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking andunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,until Biddy called to me that I was late.It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,“Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who waslaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,and threw my arms around Joe’s neck. Then I took up my littleportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when Ipresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwingan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stoppedthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm abovehis head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to herface.I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I hadsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done tohave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the HighStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was verypeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if toshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and allbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heaveand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of thevillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear,dear friend!”Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rainupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I wasbetter after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my owningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joewith me then.So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in thecourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it wasclear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I wouldnot get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have anotherevening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not madeup my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quitepracticable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And whileI was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exactresemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and myheart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far togo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, andthe world lay spread before me.This is the end of the first stage of Pip’s expectations.Chapter XX.The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about fivehours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach bywhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out aboutthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it wastreasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think Imight have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,crooked, narrow, and dirty.Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, andhe had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and closeby the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed tohave as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packedme up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrierof steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting onhis box, which I remember to have been decorated with an oldweather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite awork of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronetsoutside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know how many footmen tohold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen fromyielding to the temptation.I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like astraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why thehorses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachmanbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stopwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an opendoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.“How much?” I asked the coachman.The coachman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman. “I don’t want toget into trouble. _I_ know _him_!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr.Jaggers’s name, and shook his head.When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed theascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve hismind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in myhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?“He is not,” returned the clerk. “He is in Court at present. Am Iaddressing Mr. Pip?”I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.“Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn’t say howlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his timebeing valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an innerchamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in avelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve onbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk.I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerkshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.Mr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a mostdismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twistedthemselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papersabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some oddobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an oldrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes andpackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarlyswollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backedchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, andbit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and theclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; thewall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy withshoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffledforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his beingturned out.I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’schair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. Icalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something toeverybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how manyother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to havethe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered whatwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it camethere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’sfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of suchill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for theblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spiritsmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust andgrit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting inMr. Jaggers’s close room, until I really could not bear the two castson the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while Iwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come intoSmithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, beingall asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick tome. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into astreet where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at mefrom behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was NewgatePrison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway coveredwith straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, andfrom the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spiritsand beer, I inferred that the trials were on.While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunkminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear atrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for halfa crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justicein his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, andpresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As Ideclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good asto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and alsowhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interestof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em”would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in themorning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me asickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’sproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to hispocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently notbelonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he hadbought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thoughtmyself well rid of him for a shilling.I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and Ifound he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tourof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I becameaware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well asI. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in BartholomewClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of thepavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other whenthey first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, andone of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comfortedher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggersis for him, ’Melia, and what more _could_ you have?” There was ared-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loiteringthere, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of ahighly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under alamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with thewords, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,give me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardianmade a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more thanever.At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Closeinto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towardsme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and therewas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder andwalking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressedhimself to his followers.First, he took the two secret men.“Now, I have nothing to say to _you_,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing hisfinger at them. “I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,it’s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have youpaid Wemmick?”“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men,submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers’s face.“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made itup at all. Has Wemmick got it?”“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.“Very well; then you may go. Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr Jaggers,waving his hand at them to put them behind him. “If you say a word tome, I’ll throw up the case.”“We thought, Mr. Jaggers—” one of the men began, pulling off his hat.“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers. “_You_ thought! Ithink for you; that’s enough for you. If I want you, I know where tofind you; I don’t want you to find me. Now I won’t have it. I won’thear a word.”The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behindagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.“And now _you_!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning onthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meeklyseparated,—“Oh! Amelia, is it?”“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me youwouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”“O yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together. “Lord bless you, sir, wellwe knows that!”“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded.“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Once for all. If you don’tknow that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it. And if you come herebothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both your Bill andyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?”“O yes, sir! Every farden.”“Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say anotherword—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. Noone remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised theskirts of Mr. Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastatingstrain: “What does this fellow want?”“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?”“Who’s he?” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let go of my coat.”The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishingit, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I am over the way.”“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance,turning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it. Get out of theway.”“Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen’th gone to MithterWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. MithterJaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you’d have the condethenthunto be bought off from the t’other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—moneyno object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!”My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, andleft him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without furtherinterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk andthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, andapproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock ofhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pullingat the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon. Well?”“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from aconstitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one, sir, asmight do.”“What is he prepared to swear?”“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap thistime; “in a general way, anythink.”Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. “Now, I warned you before,”said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that if youever presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of you. Youinfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconsciouswhat he had done.“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with hiselbow. “Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?”“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly,“once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here isprepared to swear?”Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lessonfrom his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to havingbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.”“Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?”Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at theceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, beforebeginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like—”when my guardian blustered out,—“What? You WILL, will you?”(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.”“Is he here?” asked my guardian.“I left him,” said Mike, “a setting on some doorsteps round thecorner.”“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in anaccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a shortsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner wasnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage ofrecovery, which was painted over.“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to theclerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing sucha fellow as that.”My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemedto bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangementshe had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr.Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; Iwas to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to gowith him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I likedit. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberalone,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cardsof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,and such other things as I could in reason want. “You will find yourcredit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smeltlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall bythis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I findyou outrunning the constable. Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, butthat’s no fault of mine.”After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I askedMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worthwhile, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,if I pleased.I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerkwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and Iaccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a wayamong them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; hewon’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them,and went on side by side.Chapter XXI.Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he waslike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short instature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to havebeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were somemarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had beensofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishmentover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth themoff. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of hislinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; forhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing alady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he werequite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glitteringeyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. He had hadthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me.“No,” said I.“_I_ was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick. “Rum to think of now!”“You are well acquainted with it now?”“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick. “I know the moves of it.”“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of sayingsomething than for information.“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there areplenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it offa little.“O! I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick; “there’s notmuch bad blood about. They’ll do it, if there’s anything to be got byit.”“That makes it worse.”“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick. “Much about the same, I shouldsay.”He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight beforehim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in thestreets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of amouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to thetop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanicalappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr. Wemmick.“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction. “At Hammersmith, west ofLondon.”“Is that far?”“Well! Say five miles.”“Do you know him?”“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at mewith an approving air. “Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!”There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance ofthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sidewaysat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,when he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn. My depression was notalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishmentto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our townwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be adisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collectionof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a clubfor Tom-cats.We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by anintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to melike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees init, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and themost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had everseen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which thosehouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind andcurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserablemakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul ofBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of thepresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzymourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance andhumiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dryrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof andcellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at handbesides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,“Try Barnard’s Mixture.”So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my greatexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. “Ah!” said he,mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country. So it doesme.”He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—whichappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one ofthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and findthemselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers onthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there wasa label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick explained. “Youdon’t want me any more?”“No, thank you,” said I.“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meetpretty often. Good day.”“Good day.”I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if hethought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correctinghimself,—“To be sure! Yes. You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,but said yes.“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except at last. Veryglad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase windowand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and itcame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had notput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy viewof the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefullylooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.Mr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearlymaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written myname with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in thewindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arosebefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of amember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag undereach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out ofbreath.“Mr. Pip?” said he.“Mr. Pocket?” said I.“Dear me!” he exclaimed. “I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was acoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you wouldcome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,—notthat that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, youmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent GardenMarket to get it good.”For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of myhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to thinkthis was a dream.“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “This door sticks so!”As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door whilethe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to holdthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated withthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the oppositedoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must startout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “Allow me to lead the way. Iam rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerablywell till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeablythrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walkabout London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. Asto our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be suppliedfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at yourexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions. As to our lodging, it’snot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and myfather hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to takeit, if he had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tablesand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. Youmustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my littlebedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;the furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer thepurpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it. Thechambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’tfight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding thefruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quiteashamed.”As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that Iknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,—“Lord bless me, you’re the prowling boy!”“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentleman!”Chapter XXII.The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another inBarnard’s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. “The idea of its beingyou!” said he. “The idea of its being _you_!” said I. And then wecontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. “Well!” said thepale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, “it’s allover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll forgiveme for having knocked you about so.”I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was thepale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his intention withhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.“You hadn’t come into your good fortune at that time?” said HerbertPocket.“No,” said I.“No,” he acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately. _I_ wasrather on the lookout for good fortune then.”“Indeed?”“Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancyto me. But she couldn’t,—at all events, she didn’t.”I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.“Bad taste,” said Herbert, laughing, “but a fact. Yes, she had sent forme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, Isuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have beenwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.”“What’s that?” I asked, with sudden gravity.He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided hisattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.“Affianced,” he explained, still busy with the fruit. “Betrothed.Engaged. What’s-his-named. Any word of that sort.”“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked.“Pooh!” said he, “I didn’t care much for it. _She’s_ a Tartar.”“Miss Havisham?”“I don’t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl’s hard andhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up byMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.”“What relation is she to Miss Havisham?”“None,” said he. “Only adopted.”“Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?”“Lord, Mr. Pip!” said he. “Don’t you know?”“No,” said I.“Dear me! It’s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. Andnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you comethere, that day?”I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burstout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn’t askhim if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectlyestablished.“Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” he went on.“Yes.”“You know he is Miss Havisham’s man of business and solicitor, and hasher confidence when nobody else has?”This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered witha constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggersin Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our combat, but never atany other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of havingever seen me there.“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and hecalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my fatherfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham’scousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for heis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.”Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, whomore strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a naturalincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was somethingwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at thesame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. Idon’t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that firstoccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by whatmeans.He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conqueredlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that didnot seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles hadtaken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always belight and young. Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat moregracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am consciousthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carriedoff my new suit.As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be abad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in acountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I wouldtake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint wheneverhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that you’llwant very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and Ishould like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do methe favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?”I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that myChristian name was Philip.“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a moralboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,or so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious thathe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go abird’s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy inthe neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,and you have been a blacksmith,—would you mind it?”“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I don’tunderstand you.”“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There’s a charming piece ofmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”“I should like it very much.”“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door opened,“here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of thetable, because the dinner is of your providing.”This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was anice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor’s Feast,—and itacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independentcircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set thebanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might havesaid, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from thecoffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of acomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiterthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fellover them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on thebookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl intomy bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butterin a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this madethe feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, mypleasure was without alloy.We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of hispromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.“True,” he replied. “I’ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce thetopic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to putthe knife in the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the forkis reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. Itis scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other peopledo. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. Thishas two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all isthe object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of openingoysters, on the part of the right elbow.”He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that weboth laughed and I scarcely blushed.“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you mustknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and herfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down inyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don’t know why it should bea crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while youcannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never wasand brew. You see it every day.”“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I.“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep agentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was hisdaughter.”“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.“Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; shehad a half-brother. Her father privately married again—his cook, Irather think.”“I thought he was proud,” said I.“My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,because he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she wasdead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and thenthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you areacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,extravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad. At last his father disinheritedhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, thoughnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass of wine,and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one tobe so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn itbottom upwards with the rim on one’s nose.”I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. Ithanked him, and apologised. He said, “Not at all,” and resumed.“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked afteras a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but whatwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.There were stronger differences between him and her than there had beenbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished adeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father’sanger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,—merely breaking off,my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into atumbler.”Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable tosay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of amuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress itwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again hesaid in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls,or anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to MissHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention thathe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that hewas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for agentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is aprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart everwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, novarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish youput on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursuedMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believeshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all thesusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and shepassionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolizedhim. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he gotgreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother outof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by hisfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husbandhe must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time inMiss Havisham’s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in loveto be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, withthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving orjealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that shewas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself toounreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrilyordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father hasnever seen her since.”I thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at lastwhen I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert whether hisfather was so inveterate against her?“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of herintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning uponher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it wouldlook true—even to him—and even to her. To return to the man and make anend of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses werebought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests wereinvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter—”“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for hermarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?”“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which sheafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that itmost heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because Idon’t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, shelaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has neversince looked upon the light of day.”“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing itout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when MissHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it wasabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten onething. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplacedconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that itwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I.“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may havebeen a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert. “Mind! I don’tknow that.”“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering thesubject.“They fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—andruin.”“Are they alive now?”“I don’t know.”“You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, butadopted. When adopted?”Herbert shrugged his shoulders. “There has always been an Estella,since I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now,Handel,” said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there isa perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about MissHavisham, you know.”“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”“I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexitybetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold youradvancement in life,—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss towhom you owe it,—you may be very sure that it will never be encroachedupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.”In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subjectdone with, even though I should be under his father’s roof for yearsand years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that Ifelt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, asI understood the fact myself.It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme forthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much thelighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this tobe the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in thecourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, “A capitalist,—anInsurer of Ships.” I suppose he saw me glancing about the room insearch of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, “In theCity.”I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships inthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insureron his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsiblehead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that oddimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital ininsuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cutinto the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None ofthese things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons onmy own account. I think I shall trade,” said he, leaning back in hischair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, andprecious woods. It’s an interesting trade.”“And the profits are large?” said I.“Tremendous!” said he.I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations thanmy own.[Illustration]“I think I shall trade, also,” said he, putting his thumbs in hiswaist-coat pockets, “to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.Also to Ceylon, especially for elephants’ tusks.”“You will want a good many ships,” said I.“A perfect fleet,” said he.Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I askedhim where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?“I haven’t begun insuring yet,” he replied. “I am looking about me.”Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s Inn. I said(in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”“Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked.“To—do you mean to the young fellow who’s in it?” he asked, in reply.“Yes; to you.”“Why, n-no; not to me.” He said this with the air of one carefullyreckoning up and striking a balance. “Not directly profitable. That is,it doesn’t pay me anything, and I have to—keep myself.”This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head asif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulativecapital from such a source of income.“But the thing is,” said Herbert Pocket, “that you look about you._That’s_ the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, andyou look about you.”It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn’t be out of acounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferredto his experience.“Then the time comes,” said Herbert, “when you see your opening. Andyou go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and thenthere you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothingto do but employ it.”This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly correspondedto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took allblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplestnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to havebeen sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was sounassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not beingpuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in thestreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went tochurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in theParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joedid.On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I hadleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and thempartook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. ThatI could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, onthe very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination ofimpossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in theLondon streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in thedusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that Ihad put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead ofnight, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooningabout Barnard’s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on myheart.On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to thecounting-house to report himself,—to look about him, too, Isuppose,—and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or twoto attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. Itappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatchedwere incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judgingfrom the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Mondaymorning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in myeyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into anotherback second floor, rather than a look out.I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I sawfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took tobe great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all beout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at acelebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to havebeen the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not helpnoticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tableclothsand knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks. This collationdisposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was notcharged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my littleportmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there attwo or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walkto Mr. Pocket’s house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed directinto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s childrenwere playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where myinterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.and Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, butwere tumbling up.Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, withher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two nurse-maidswere looking about them while the children played. “Mamma,” saidHerbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.” Upon which Mrs. Pocket received mewith an appearance of amiable dignity.“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of thechildren, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall overinto the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then?”At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief, andsaid, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!” Upon whichMrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settlingherself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenanceimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had beenreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quitewell?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that Ibegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any suchperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would havebeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when thenurse came to my rescue.“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that don’tmake seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!” Mrs.Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterablesurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh ofrecognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went onreading.I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer thansix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I hadscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in theregion of air, wailing dolefully.“If there ain’t Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it mostsurprising. “Make haste up, Millers.”Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and bydegrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were ayoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read allthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at anyrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing theremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayednear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up andtumbled over her,—always very much to her momentary astonishment, andtheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account forthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind tospeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, babyand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for amoment, “everybody’s tumbling!”“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face;“what have you got there?”“_I_ got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep itunder your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling? Here! Take thebaby, Mum, and give me your book.”Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant alittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This hadlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary ordersthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I madethe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of thelittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got thechildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocketcame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised tofind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expressionof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if hedidn’t quite see his way to putting anything straight.Chapter XXIII.Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry tosee him. “For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s smile, “analarming personage.” He was a young-looking man, in spite of hisperplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quitenatural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it wouldhave been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it wasvery near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said toMrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, whichwere black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.” She then smiled uponme in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste oforange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, onany foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have beenthrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversationalcondescension.I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceasedKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceasedfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determinedopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, ifI ever knew,—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the LordChancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s,—and had tackedhimself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quitesupposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself forstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperateaddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the firststone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personageeither the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directedMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the natureof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from theacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young ladyby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, butperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who wasalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether tomount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doingthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pockethad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, itwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without theknowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothingto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled thatdower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocketthat his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had investedthe Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it wassupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object ofa queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was apleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort formy own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two othersimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummleand Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order ofarchitecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger ofexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebodyelse’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the houseand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be theservants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect ofsaving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for theservants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in theireating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. Theyallowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it alwaysappeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boardedin would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable ofself-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring ladywith whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say thatshe had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that itwas an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn’t mind their ownbusiness.By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had beeneducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguishedhimself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocketvery early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up thecalling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whomit was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were alwaysgoing to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when theblades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work andhad come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, hehad “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turnedhis acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, stillmaintained the house I saw.Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highlysympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.This lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking herdown to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understandon the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to readwith him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love andconfidence (at that time, I had known her something less than fiveminutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.“But dear Mrs. Pocket,” said Mrs. Coiler, “after her earlydisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),requires so much luxury and elegance—”“Yes, ma’am,” I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going tocry.“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—”“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before.“—That it _is_ hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s timeand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s timeand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my companymanners.It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket andDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, andother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christianname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. Itfurther appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in thegarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at whichher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come atall. Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as asulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coilerthe toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of theconversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; butit promised to last a long time, when the page came in with theannouncement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cookhad mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the firsttime, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performancethat struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression onanybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. Helaid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at themoment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to makean extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had donethis, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on withwhat he was about.Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I likedit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that thepleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at mewhen she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends andlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; andwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very littleto her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them forbeing on the opposite side of the table.After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler madeadmiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way ofimproving their minds. There were four little girls, and two littleboys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s nextsuccessor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson andMillers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had beenrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if sherather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, butdidn’t quite know what to make of them.“Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson. “Don’ttake it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head uponthe table; which was announced to all present by a prodigiousconcussion.“Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss Jane, comeand dance to baby, do!”One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurelytaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her placeby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, andlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in themeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,and we all laughed and were glad.Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the nut-crackersto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take noticethat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with itseyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, thetwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircasewith a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearlylost half his buttons at the gaming-table.I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into adiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate asliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about thebaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed thedangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about thesame time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—“You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!”“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith eyethout.”“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket. “Go and sit down inyour chair this moment!”Mrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as ifI myself had done something to rouse it.“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,“how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for theprotection of baby.”“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket. “I amsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront ofinterference.”“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.“Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody tosave them?”“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with amajestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know mypoor grandpapa’s position. Jane, indeed!”Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really didlift himself some inches out of his chair. “Hear this!” he helplesslyexclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, forpeople’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down again,and became silent.We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. Apause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made aseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be theonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it hadany decided acquaintance.“Mr. Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson? Jane, youundutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come withma!”The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. Itdoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited apair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of itssoft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And itgained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within afew minutes, being nursed by little Jane.It happened that the other five children were left behind at thedinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, andtheir not being anybody else’s business. I thus became aware of themutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified inthe following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of hisface heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,as if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging inthat establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature onsomebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certainquestions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fannycame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice itwhen she didn’t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, andgave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then asthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by thehair he dismissed the hopeless subject.In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startophad each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. Iwas pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, butas I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not tosay for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under thetuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and towhom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authorityconfused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If hecould have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubtif he would have paid it.There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think weshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeabledomestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaidcame in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was rousedagain. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Orspeak to me—at some other time.”“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish tospeak at once, and to speak to master.”Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best ofourselves until he came back.“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with acountenance expressive of grief and despair. “Here’s the cook lyinginsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of freshbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This isthat odious Sophia’s doing!”“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket.“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket. “Did I not see her with my owneyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and askto speak to you?”“But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,” returned Mr. Pocket,“and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for makingmischief?”Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” saidMrs. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectfulwoman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look afterthe situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in theattitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with ahollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to goto bed and leave him.Chapter XXIV.After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room andhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and hadordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talktogether. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for hereferred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designedfor any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for mydestiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men inprosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing tothe contrary.He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisitionof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with thefunctions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped thatwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through hisway of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himselfon confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may stateat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling hiscompact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfillingmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have nodoubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me nosuch excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I everregard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but whatwas serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I hadbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain mybedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while mymanners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society. Mr. Pocket didnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step couldpossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I feltthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan wouldsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and impartedmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one ortwo other little things, I should be quite at home there.”“Go it!” said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. “I told you you’d geton. Well! How much do you want?”I said I didn’t know how much.“Come!” retorted Mr. Jaggers. “How much? Fifty pounds?”“O, not nearly so much.”“Five pounds?” said Mr. Jaggers.This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “O, more thanthat.”“More than that, eh!” retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, withhis hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on thewall behind me; “how much more?”“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating.“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let’s get at it. Twice five; will that do?Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?”I said I thought that would do handsomely.“Four times five will do handsomely, will it?” said Mr. Jaggers,knitting his brows. “Now, what do you make of four times five?”“What do I make of it?”“Ah!” said Mr. Jaggers; “how much?”“I suppose you make it twenty pounds,” said I, smiling.“Never mind what _I_ make it, my friend,” observed Mr. Jaggers, with aknowing and contradictory toss of his head. “I want to know what _you_make it.”“Twenty pounds, of course.”“Wemmick!” said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. “Take Mr. Pip’swritten order, and pay him twenty pounds.”This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly markedimpression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers neverlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poisinghimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrowsjoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots tocreak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happenedto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said toWemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers’s manner.“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick;“he don’t mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.—Oh!” for Ilooked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional: onlyprofessional.”Wemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit;pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, asif he were posting them.“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a man-trap andwas watching it. Suddenly—click—you’re caught!”Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,I said I supposed he was very skilful?“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at theoffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for thepurposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of theglobe. “If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pento paper, “he’d be it.”Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,“Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which hereplied,—“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers, andpeople won’t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Wouldyou like to see ’em? You are one of us, as I may say.”I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into thepost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key ofwhich safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from hiscoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was darkand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.Jaggers’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircasefor years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked somethingbetween a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollenman—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabbyappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed tobe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s coffers. “Getting evidencetogether,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In theroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) wassimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presentedto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would meltme anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, ahigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who wasdressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having beenwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes ofthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmickled me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve seen already.”“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon themcaught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust offthe horrible heads before bringing them down. “These are two celebratedones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into theinkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murderedhis master, and, considering that he wasn’t brought up to evidence,didn’t plan it badly.”“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spatupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.“Like him? It’s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,hadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained thisaffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the ladyand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,“Had it made for me, express!”“Is the lady anybody?” said I.“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,didn’t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, exceptone,—and she wasn’t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn’thave caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something todrink in it.” Wemmick’s attention being thus directed to his brooch, heput down the cast, and polished the brooch with hispocket-handkerchief.“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “He has thesame look.”“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look. Much as if onenostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, hecame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. Heforged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposedtestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr.Wemmick was again apostrophising), “and you said you could write Greek.Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!”Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched thelargest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me,only the day before.”While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derivedfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, Iventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stoodbefore me, dusting his hands.“O yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind. One bringsanother, you see; that’s the way of it. I always take ’em. They’recuriosities. And they’re property. They may not be worth much, but,after all, they’re property and portable. It don’t signify to you withyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,‘Get hold of portable property’.”When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in afriendly manner:—“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn’tmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and Ishould consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such twoor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and Iam fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off, whenconvenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”“Not yet.”“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine. I’ll giveyou punch, and not bad punch. And now I’ll tell you something. When yougo to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”“Shall I see something very uncommon?”“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so veryuncommon, you’ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the originalwildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won’t lower youropinion of Mr. Jaggers’s powers. Keep your eye on it.”I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that hispreparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if Iwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”For several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know whatMr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative. Wedived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where ablood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with thefanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortablychewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination orcross-examination,—I don’t know which,—and was striking her, and thebench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoeverdegree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required tohave it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite ofhis finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on hiswords, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in theirdirection. Which side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed tome to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when Istole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he wasmaking the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsiveunder the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as therepresentative of British law and justice in that chair that day.Chapter XXV.Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a bookas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up anacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, andcomprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in thelarge, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as hehimself lolled about in a room,—he was idle, proud, niggardly,reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made thediscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, BentleyDrummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than thatgentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he oughtto have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, andadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, andwas—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert tome—“exactly like his mother.” It was but natural that I should take tohim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliestevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of oneanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up inour wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. Hewould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibiouscreature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; andI always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by theback-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or themoonlight in mid-stream.Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with ahalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming downto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers oftentook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at allhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not sopleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility ofuntried youth and hope.When I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister. Georgiana, whom Ihad seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up. Shewas a cousin,—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidityreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred ofcupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon mein my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as agrown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed thecomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they heldin contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavilydisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light uponthemselves.These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and appliedmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and beganto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I shouldhave thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to mybooks. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough tofeel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start Iwanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been asgreat a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would writehim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. Hereplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expectme at the office at six o’clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under thedesk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I’ll tell youwhat I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—whichis of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from thecook’s-shop. I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was aJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out agood one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the boxanother day or two, we could easily have done it.” He said to that,“Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let him, ofcourse. As far as it goes, it’s property and portable. You don’t objectto an aged parent, I hope?”I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said whatpoliteness required.“So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walkedalong.“Not yet.”“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expectyou’ll have an invitation to-morrow. He’s going to ask your pals, too.Three of ’em; ain’t there?”Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of myintimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang,”—I hardly felt complimented bythe word,—“and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you good. Don’t lookforward to variety, but you’ll have excellence. And there’s another rumthing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment’s pause, as ifthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “he never lets adoor or window be fastened at night.”“Is he never robbed?”“That’s it!” returned Wemmick. “He says, and gives it out publicly, “Iwant to see the man who’ll rob _me_.” Lord bless you, I have heard him,a hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen inour front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawnthere; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can’t Itempt you?” Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,for love or money.”“They dread him so much?” said I.“Dread him,” said Wemmick. “I believe you they dread him. Not but whathe’s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britanniametal, every spoon.”“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they—”“Ah! But _he_ would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “andthey know it. He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of ’em.He’d have all he could get. And it’s impossible to say what he couldn’tget, if he gave his mind to it.”I was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when Wemmickremarked:—“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you know. Ariver’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth. Look at hiswatch-chain. That’s real enough.”“It’s very massive,” said I.“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so. And his watch is a goldrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all aboutthat watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, whowouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if itwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.”At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of amore general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and theroad, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in thedistrict of Walworth.It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and littlegardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.Wemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots ofgarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a batterymounted with guns.“My own doing,” said Wemmick. “Looks pretty; don’t it?”I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of themsham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I runup a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, Ihoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide andtwo deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which hehoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish andnot merely mechanically.“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gunfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you’llsay he’s a Stinger.”The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by aningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impedethe idea of fortifications,—for it’s a principle with me, if you havean idea, carry it out and keep it up,—I don’t know whether that’s youropinion—”I said, decidedly.“—At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, Iknock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; andyou’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,” saidWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, “ifyou can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil ofa time in point of provisions.”Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which wasapproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a longtime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bowerwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle whichmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and hehad constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little millgoing and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extentthat it made the back of your hand quite wet.“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and myown gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, inacknowledging my compliments. “Well; it’s a good thing, you know. Itbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn’tmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn’t putyou out?”I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There wefound, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordialand jocose way, “how am you?”“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man.“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hearhis name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes. Nod away athim, if you please, like winking!”“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while Inodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasure-ground,sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kepttogether by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’senjoyment.”“You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick,contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;“_there’s_ a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “_there’s_another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you likethat, don’t you? If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiringto strangers—will you tip him one more? You can’t think how it pleaseshim.”I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left himbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch inthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it hadtaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its presentpitch of perfection.“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It’s afreehold, by George!”“Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life isanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, andwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s notin any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. Idon’t wish it professionally spoken about.”Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of hisrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it andtalking, until it was almost nine o’clock. “Getting near gun-fire,”said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this greatnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until themoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, andrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently theStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of acottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacupin it ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown outof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly,“He’s fired! I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until itis no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing mehis collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a feloniouscharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had beencommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, andseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon whichMr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “everyone of ’em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among smallspecimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by theproprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I hadbeen first inducted, and which served, not only as the generalsitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepanon the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for thesuspension of a roasting-jack.There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Agedin the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was loweredto give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supperwas excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rotinsomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might havebeen farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond therebeing such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that whenI lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance thatpole on my forehead all night.Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard himcleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him frommy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in amost devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and athalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightenedinto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of businessand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked asunconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and thedrawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of theStinger.Chapter XXVI.It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an earlyopportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of hiscashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands withhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and hecalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friendswhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. “No ceremony,” he stipulated,“and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked him where we shouldcome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in hisgeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,“Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunityof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon ora dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop. It had anunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he wouldwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from hisroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, heseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion thanusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not onlywashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. Andeven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails beforehe put his coat on.There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out intothe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there wassomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled hispresence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked alongwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd ofthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but henever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybodyrecognised him.He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south sideof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully inwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key andopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, andlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three darkbrown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on thepanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I knowwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was hisdressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held thewhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table wascomfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side ofhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles anddecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticedthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributedeverything himself.There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all verysolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was alittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bringthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of anevening and fall to work.As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I hadwalked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once tobe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me tothe window, “I don’t know one from the other. Who’s the Spider?”“The spider?” said I.“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face isStartop.”Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” hereturned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of thatfellow.”He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by hisreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it toscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there camebetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought heryounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremelypale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannotsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to beparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curiousexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to seeMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face lookedto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I hadseen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with afinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seatsat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that thehousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choicemutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, allthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by ourhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of thetable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us cleanplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those justdisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendantthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always sawin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I madea dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no othernatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to passbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her ownstriking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed thatwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on myguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she putbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, andwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. Ifancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, anda purpose of always holding her in suspense.Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow ratherthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part ofour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressingmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and toboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened mylips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: thedevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspiciousway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that ourconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was ralliedfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room toour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and thatas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisibleagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocityabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to showhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms ina ridiculous manner.Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger andshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap,as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he dothis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “_I_’ll show you a wrist.Molly, let them see your wrist.”Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her otherhand behind her waist. “Master,” she said, in a low voice, with hereyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. “Don’t.”“_I_’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovabledetermination to show it. “Molly, let them see your wrist.”“Master,” she again murmured. “Please!”“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately lookingat the opposite side of the room, “let them see _both_ your wrists.Show them. Come!”He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. Shebrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side byside. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarredacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes fromMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of usin succession.“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinewswith his forefinger. “Very few men have the power of wrist that thiswoman has. It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in thesehands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never sawstronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continuedto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The momenthe ceased, she looked at him again. “That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr.Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass andpassed round the wine.“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up. Pray makethe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, Idrink to you.”If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morosedepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemedto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’s wine.In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon someboorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free withour money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, thatit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in mypresence but a week or so before.“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make youhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”“_You_ should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lord!”“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’tlend money to any of us if we wanted it.”“You are right,” said Drummle. “I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”“_You_ should say,” repeated Drummle. “Oh Lord!”This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myselfmaking no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregardingHerbert’s efforts to check me,—“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you whatpassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”“_I_ don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,”growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we mightboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not. Wesaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemedto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his handsin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying thatit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace thanI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exactopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a directpersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startoptried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that madeus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of hispockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, andwould have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’sdexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for thatpurpose.“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, andhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedinglysorry to announce that it’s half past nine.”On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing hadhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would noteven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of thehouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there fora moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I foundhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hardat it, washing his hands of us.I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anythingdisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blameme much.“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through thewater-drops; “it’s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.”He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,and towelling himself.“I am glad you like him, sir,” said I—“but I don’t.”“No, no,” my guardian assented; “don’t have too much to do with him.Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is oneof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller—”Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.“But I am not a fortune-teller,” he said, letting his head drop into afestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. “You know what Iam, don’t you? Good night, Pip.”“Good night, sir.”In about a month after that, the Spider’s time with Mr. Pocket was upfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, hewent home to the family hole.Chapter XXVII.“MY DEAR MR PIP:—“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he isgoing to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad ifagreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard’s HotelTuesday morning at nine o’clock, when if not agreeable please leaveword. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk ofyou in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying anddoing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for thelove of poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from“Your ever obliged, and affectionate servant,“BIDDY.”“P.S. He wishes me most particular to write _what larks_. He says youwill understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to seehim, even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he isa worthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the lastlittle sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again _whatlarks_.”I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore itsappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelingsI looked forward to Joe’s coming.Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; withconsiderable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense ofincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainlywould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was comingto Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fallin Bentley Drummle’s way. I had little objection to his being seen byHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had thesharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held incontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses areusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quiteunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive thosewrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastlydifferent from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour ofoccupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouringupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started aboy in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might havebeen said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out ofthe refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a bluecoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the bootsalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal toeat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted myexistence.This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesdaymorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged forfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that hethought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for beingso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense ofsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, hewouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it.However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, andI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room andbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunatelythe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the factthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like someweak giant of a Sweep.As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avengerpursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on thestaircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of comingupstairs,—his state boots being always too big for him,—and by the timeit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of hisascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear hisfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwardsdistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave afaint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of theavenging boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!” I thought he never would havedone wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off themat, but at last he came in.“Joe, how are you, Joe?”“Pip, how AIR you, Pip?”With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put downon the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked themstraight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.“I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.”But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nestwith eggs in it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property,and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and thatgentle-folked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;“as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.”“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”“Thank God,” said Joe, “I’m ekerval to most. And your sister, she’s noworse than she were. And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready. And allfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. ’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had adrop.”All this time (still with both hands taking great care of thebird’s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, andround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.“Had a drop, Joe?”“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church and wentinto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him toLondon along with me. And his wish were,” said Joe, getting thebird’s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for anegg with his right; “if no offence, as I would ’and you that.”I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of asmall metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in thatvery week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our NationalBard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramaticcircles.”“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired.“I _were_,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.“Was there a great sensation?”“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.Partickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,whether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a goodhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with“Amen!” A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,” saidJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but thatis no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which Imeantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be allowed toclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning ’atis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathersbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herberthad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out hishand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest.“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here hiseye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and soplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of thefamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more—“I meantersay, youtwo gentlemen,—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,”said Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand it; butI wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case that I wished himto fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.”Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of ourdwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me“sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round theroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,—as if it wereonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find aresting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of thechimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who alwayspresided of a morning.“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whicheveris most agreeable to yourself.”“What do you say to coffee?”“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,“since you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not runcontrairy to your own opinions. But don’t you never find it a little’eating?”“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of hischair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if itwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off againsoon.“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind hishand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.“No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon” (withan appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).“Have you seen anything of London yet?”“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look atthe Blacking Ware’us. But we didn’t find that it come up to itslikeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” addedJoe, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd tooarchitectooralooral.”I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightilyexpressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfectChorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by hishat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constantattention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted bywicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed thegreatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as itdropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouringit in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the patternof the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;finally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty oflaying hands upon it.[Illustration]As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing toreflect upon,—insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himselfto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Whyshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for hisholiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits ofmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; hadhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with suchremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much morethan he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I washeartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this wasall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would havebeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper withhim; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.“Us two being now alone, sir,”—began Joe.“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, sir?”Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly likereproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collarswere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the intentionsand abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will nowconclude—leastways begin—to mention what have led to my having had thepresent honour. For was it not,” said Joe, with his old air of lucidexposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should nothave had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode ofgentlemen.”I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstranceagainst this tone.“Well, sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were. I were at the Bargement’other night, Pip;”—whenever he subsided into affection, he called mePip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; “whenthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that sameidentical,” said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my ’air thewrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it werehim which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as aplayfellow by yourself.”“Nonsense. It was you, Joe.”“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing hishead, “though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this sameidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at theBargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to theworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were,‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.’”“Miss Havisham, Joe?”“‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’” Joe sat androlled his eyes at the ceiling.“Yes, Joe? Go on, please.”“Next day, sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,“having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”“Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?”“Which I say, sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as ifhe were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Herexpression air then as follering: ‘Mr. Gargery. You air incorrespondence with Mr. Pip?’ Having had a letter from you, I were ableto say ‘I am.’ (When I married your sister, sir, I said ‘I will;’ andwhen I answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you tell him,then,’ said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad tosee him.’”I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause ofits firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known hiserrand, I should have given him more encouragement.“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write themessage to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, ‘I know he will be veryglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to seehim, go!’ I have now concluded, sir,” said Joe, rising from his chair,“and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and agreater height.”“But you are not going now, Joe?”“Yes I am,” said Joe.“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”“No I am not,” said Joe.Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as hegave me his hand.“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings weldedtogether, as I may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s awhitesmith, and one’s a goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith. Diwisionsamong such must come, and must be met as they come. If there’s been anyfault at all to-day, it’s mine. You and me is not two figures to betogether in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, andbeknown, and understood among friends. It ain’t that I am proud, butthat I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in theseclothes. I’m wrong in these clothes. I’m wrong out of the forge, thekitchen, or off th’ meshes. You won’t find half so much fault in me ifyou think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or evenmy pipe. You won’t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as youshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forgewindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the oldburnt apron, sticking to the old work. I’m awful dull, but I hope I’vebeat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD blessyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!”I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity inhim. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when hespoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touchedme gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recovermyself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in theneighbouring streets; but he was gone.Chapter XXVIII.It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the firstflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe’s.But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow’s coach, and had beendown to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means convinced on thelast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting upat the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe’s; I was notexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from MissHavisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t like it. All otherswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with suchpretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I shouldinnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else’s manufacture isreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coinof my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence ofcompactly folding up my bank-notes for security’s sake, abstracts thenotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was muchdisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It wastempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his bootsin the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn toimagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop, and confounding thedisrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy. On the other hand, Trabb’s boymight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, recklessand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the HighStreet. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On thewhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, aswinter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination untiltwo or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keyswas two o’clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour tospare, attended by the Avenger,—if I may connect that expression withone who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yardsby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outsidepassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road danglingtheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprisedwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there weretwo convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an oldreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word“convict.”“You don’t mind them, Handel?” said Herbert.“O no!”“I thought you seemed as if you didn’t like them?”“I can’t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don’tparticularly. But I don’t mind them.”“See! There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap. What adegraded and vile sight it is!”They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaolerwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on theirlegs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that Ilikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried athick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of goodunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on atthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convictswere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and hethe Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, andappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of theworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smallersuit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of thoseshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew hishalf-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen onthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who hadbrought me down with his invisible gun!It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he hadnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eyeappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and saidsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselvesround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at somethingelse. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were loweranimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded withpocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at themand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeableand degraded spectacle.But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of theback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, andthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat infront behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who hadtaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with suchvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, andinfamous, and shameful, and I don’t know what else. At this time thecoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparingto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringingwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, andhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.“Don’t take it so much amiss, sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angrypassenger; “I’ll sit next you myself. I’ll put ’em on the outside ofthe row. They won’t interfere with you, sir. You needn’t know they’rethere.”“And don’t blame _me_,” growled the convict I had recognised. “_I_don’t want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I amconcerned any one’s welcome to _my_ place.”“Or mine,” said the other, gruffly. “_I_ wouldn’t have incommoded noneof you, if I’d had _my_ way.” Then they both laughed, and begancracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think Ishould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and sodespised.At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. Sohe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got intothe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well asthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with hisbreath on the hair of my head.“Good-bye, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started. I thought what ablessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’sbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. Thesensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent andsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have morebreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise indoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made usall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-wayHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozedoff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore acouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if Iwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took thequestion up again.But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although Icould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights andshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind thatblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen againstthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very firstwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words ofmy own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”“How did he get ’em?” said the convict I had never seen.“How should I know?” returned the other. “He had ’em stowed awaysomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.”“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that Ihad ’em here.”“Two one pound notes, or friends?”“Two one pound notes. I’d sell all the friends I ever had for one, andthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says—?”“So he says,” resumed the convict I had recognised,—“it was all saidand done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in theDock-yard,—‘You’re a-going to be discharged?’ Yes, I was. Would I findout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them twoone pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.”“More fool you,” growled the other. “I’d have spent ’em on a Man, inwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowednothing of you?”“Not a ha’porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was triedagain for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”“And was that—Honour!—the only time you worked out, in this part of thecountry?”“The only time.”“What might have been your opinion of the place?”“A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,mist, and mudbank.”They both execrated the place in very strong language, and graduallygrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down andbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feelingcertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was notonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed andso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he couldhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of ourbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with adread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, inhis hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight assoon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. Thisdevice I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the bootunder my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it downbefore me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on thefirst stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went theirway with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited offto the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waitingfor them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way,you!” like and order to dogs,—again saw the wicked Noah’s Ark lying outon the black water.I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogetherundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked onto the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehensionof a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I amconfident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was therevival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only orderedmy dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. Assoon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory, he asked meif he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?“No,” said I, “certainly not.”The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance fromthe Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, andtook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a localnewspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read thisparagraph:—Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in referenceto the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron ofthis neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of ouras yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of ourcolumns!) that the youth’s earliest patron, companion, and friend, wasa highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the cornand seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious businesspremises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It isnot wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM asthe Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that ourtown produced the founder of the latter’s fortunes. Does thethought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of localBeauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was theBLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in thedays of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have metsomebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would havetold me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of myfortunes.Chapter XXIX.Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go toMiss Havisham’s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham’s sideof town,—which was not Joe’s side; I could go there to-morrow,—thinkingabout my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans forme.She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it couldnot fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it forme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the darkrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear downthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in short, do all the shining deeds ofthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped tolook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blockedwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys withits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a richattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was theinspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she hadtaken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were soset upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character hadbeen all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest herwith any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in thisplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to befollowed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, theconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualifiedtruth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved hersimply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to mysorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her againstreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, againsthappiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; Iloved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influencein restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be humanperfection.I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When Ihad rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon thegate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heartmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across thecourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on itsrusty hinges.Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I startedmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sobergrey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place ofporter at Miss Havisham’s door.“Orlick!”“Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours. But come in, comein. It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. “Yes!”said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towardsthe house. “Here I am!”“How did you come here?”“I come here,” he retorted, “on my legs. I had my box brought alongsideme in a barrow.”“Are you here for good?”“I ain’t here for harm, young master, I suppose?”I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in mymind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up mylegs and arms, to my face.“Then you have left the forge?” I said.“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance allround him with an air of injury. “Now, do it look like it?”I asked him how long he had left Gargery’s forge?“One day is so like another here,” he replied, “that I don’t knowwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.”“I could have told you that, Orlick.”“Ah!” said he, dryly. “But then you’ve got to be a scholar.”By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be onejust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on thecourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind ofplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys werehanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and hispatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. Thewhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for ahuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of acorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it wasfitted up,—as indeed he was.“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be noPorter here.”“No,” said he; “not till it got about that there was no protection onthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts andTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommendedto the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought,and I took it. It’s easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That’sloaded, that is.”My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over thechimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up toMiss Havisham?”“Burn me, if I know!” he retorted, first stretching himself and thenshaking himself; “my orders ends here, young master. I give this herebell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage tillyou meet somebody.”“I am expected, I believe?”“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he.Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden inmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, whoappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reasonof me.“Oh!” said she. “You, is it, Mr. Pip?”“It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and familyare all well.”“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;“they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You knowyour way, sir?”Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. Iascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my oldway at the door of Miss Havisham’s room. “Pip’s rap,” I heard her say,immediately; “come in, Pip.”She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her twohands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes onthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never beenworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was anelegant lady whom I had never seen.“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without lookinground or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand asif I were a queen, eh?—Well?”She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in agrimly playful manner,—“Well?”“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were sokind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”“Well?”The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and lookedarchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes. But shewas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, thatI seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that Islipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O thesense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and theinaccessibility that came about her!She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I feltin seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for along, long time.“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham, with hergreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood betweenthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estellain the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously intothe old—”“What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havishaminterrupted. “She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go awayfrom her. Don’t you remember?”I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no betterthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said shehad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been verydisagreeable.“Is _he_ changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me.“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella’shair.Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,but she lured me on.We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had sowrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home fromFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty thatit was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate themfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presencefrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that haddisturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that hadfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,—from all those visions that hadraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on theanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the woodenwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for meto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost lifeof my life.It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, andreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we hadconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in theneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheelher about a little, as in times of yore.So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which Ihad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. Aswe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,—“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fightthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”“You rewarded me very much.”“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. “I remember Ientertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it illthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”“He and I are great friends now.”“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”“Yes.”I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyishlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed yourcompanions,” said Estella.“Naturally,” said I.“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit companyfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingeringintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation putit to flight.“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” saidEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fightingtimes.“Not the least.”The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at myside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked athers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in memore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by beingso set apart for her and assigned to her.The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, andafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out againinto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen herwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold andcareless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she hadcome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “Idon’t remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I. “No,”said she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believethat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cryagain, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all.“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant andbeautiful woman might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything todo with my memory.”I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty ofdoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beautywithout it.“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” saidEstella, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. Butyou know what I mean. I have no softness there,no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”What _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still andlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?No. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge ofresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have beenacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been muchassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, willproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between facesthat are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this toMiss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,the suggestion was gone.What _was_ it?“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her browwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be thrownmuch together, you had better believe it at once. No!” imperiouslystopping me as I opened my lips. “I have not bestowed my tendernessanywhere. I have never had any such thing.”In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and shepointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that samefirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and tohave seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossedme. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.What _was_ it?“What is the matter?” asked Estella. “Are you scared again?”“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turnit off.“Then you don’t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham willsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might belaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more roundof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for mycruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one handnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. Wewalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all inbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks ofthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, itcould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for morein her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which herbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of mydelight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patronesshad chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, andwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers inthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted whilewe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we beganthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, inthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in thechair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright andbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centreof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered armsstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellowcloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at thedoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensitythat was of its kind quite dreadful.Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, andsaid in a whisper,—“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?”“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers asshe sat in the chair. “Love her, love her, love her! How does she useyou?”Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a questionat all) she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her! If she favoursyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart topieces,—and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,—loveher, love her, love her!”Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to herutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin armround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.“Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.Love her!”She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that shemeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate insteadof love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from herlips more like a curse.“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,“what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioningself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourselfand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to thesmiter—as I did!”When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caughther round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of adress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struckherself against the wall and fallen dead.All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, Iwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian inthe room.He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) apocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which wasof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify aclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchiefas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, asif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client orwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followeddirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room hehad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was lookingat us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silentpause in that attitude, “Indeed? Singular!” and then put thehandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, andstammered that he was as punctual as ever.“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us. “(How do you do,Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so youare here, Pip?”I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me tocome and see Estella. To which he replied, “Ah! Very fine young lady!”Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of hislarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocketwere full of secrets.“Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he, whenhe came to a stop.“How often?”“Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?”“Oh! Certainly not so many.”“Twice?”“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pipalone, and go with him to your dinner.”He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. Whilewe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the pavedyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eatand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundredtimes and once.I considered, and said, “Never.”“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile. “She hasnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived thispresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then layshands on such food as she takes.”“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it. Put yourquestion.”“Estella’s name. Is it Havisham or—?” I had nothing to add.“Or what?” said he.“Is it Havisham?”“It is Havisham.”This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaitedus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my greenand yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by amaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, butwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the wholetime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before myguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and thetwo ladies left us.Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under thatroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks tohimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once duringdinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she oftenlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but hisface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took adry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by oftenreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that heextorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those referencesout of my innocent self.And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon himof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, thatreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he hadnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tastedthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glassagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, andcross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I hadknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three orfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever hesaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in hishand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me totake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn’t answer.I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her inthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off hercap,—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—andstrewing the ground with her hair,—which assuredly had never grown on_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to MissHavisham’s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, MissHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewelsfrom her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and about her bosom andarms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thickeyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.[Illustration]Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, andcame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which theglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,of the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally inthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found outlong ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between hiscold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew Icould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could neverbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bearto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should bewithin a foot or two of him,—it was, that my feelings should be in thesame place with him,—_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.We played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that whenEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and shouldmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched herand left her.My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into thenight, Miss Havisham’s words, “Love her, love her, love her!” soundedin my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to mypillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times. Then,a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,once the blacksmith’s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, byno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would shebegin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within herthat was mute and sleeping now?Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I neverthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,because I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, Godforgive me! soon dried.Chapter XXX.After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boarin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick’sbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham’s.“Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,” said my guardian,comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the manwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.” It seemedquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was notexceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in asatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. “Verygood, Pip,” he observed, when I had concluded, “I’ll go roundpresently, and pay our friend off.” Rather alarmed by this summaryaction, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friendhimself might be difficult to deal with. “Oh no he won’t,” said myguardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfectconfidence; “I should like to see him argue the question with _me_.”As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as Ibreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcelyhold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted awalk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggerswas occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get intomy place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boarimmediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple ofmiles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook’s premises, Igot round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, andfelt myself in comparative security.It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it wasnot disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and staredafter. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shopsand went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on whichoccasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; theyof not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was adistinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, untilFate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb’s boy.Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, Ibeheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would bestbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advancedwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulatingmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb’s boy smotetogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently inevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,“Hold me! I’m so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror andcontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passedhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark ofextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advancedanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,and indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching. He was cominground a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honestindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s withcheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he becameaware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time hismotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with kneesmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. Hissufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,and I felt utterly confounded.I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, whenI again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, hewas entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of mygreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on theopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted youngfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of hishand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravationand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when passing abreast of me,he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an armakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, ’ponmy soul don’t know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediatelyafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge withcrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I wasa blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, andwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.[Illustration]But unless I had taken the life of Trabb’s boy on that occasion, Ireally do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To havestruggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lowerrecompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been futileand degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; aninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flewout again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,however, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip mustdecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owedto the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excitedLoathing in every respectable mind.The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took mybox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,—but not sound, for my heartwas gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrelof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and thenwent on to Barnard’s Inn.I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition tothe dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to myfriend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avengerin the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of anantechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof ofthe severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely beafforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven tofind him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him toHyde Park corner to see what o’clock it was.Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said toHerbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tellyou.”“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect yourconfidence.”“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because Ididn’t go on.“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “I love—Iadore—Estella.”Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easymatter-of-course way, “Exactly. Well?”“Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?”“What next, I mean?” said Herbert. “Of course I know _that_.”“How do you know it?” said I.“How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.”“I never told you.”“Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but Ihave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever sinceI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau heretogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When youtold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring herthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.”“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcomelight, “I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, amost beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. Andif I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked outfor her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground,we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves ofthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella’s views on the adorationquestion?”I shook my head gloomily. “Oh! She is thousands of miles away, fromme,” said I.“Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you havesomething more to say?”“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it’s no worse to say itthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was ablacksmith’s boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?”“Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert, smiling,and clapping his hand on the back of mine—“a good fellow, withimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action anddreaming, curiously mixed in him.”I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was thismixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised theanalysis, but thought it not worth disputing.“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on, “Isuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I havedone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raisedme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella—”(“And when don’t you, you know?” Herbert threw in, with his eyes on thefire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)“—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertainI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbiddenground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy ofone person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at thebest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely whatthey are!” In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always beenthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, “it seems tome that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking intoour gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems tome that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogetheroverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn’t you tell me thatyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you werenot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told youso,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that ofall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relationstowards you unless he were sure of his ground?”I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (peopleoften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truthand justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!“I should think it _was_ a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I shouldthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, youmust bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.You’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and thenperhaps you’ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you’ll benearer getting it, for it must come at last.”“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring hischeery ways.“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else. I mustacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said isnot my own, but my father’s. The only remark I ever heard him make onyour story, was the final one, “The thing is settled and done, or Mr.Jaggers would not be in it.” And now before I say anything more aboutmy father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with confidence, Iwant to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for amoment,—positively repulsive.”“You won’t succeed,” said I.“O yes I shall!” said he. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it.Handel, my good fellow;”—though he spoke in this light tone, he wasvery much in earnest,—“I have been thinking since we have been talkingwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a conditionof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. AmI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he neverreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriageultimately?”“Never.”“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon mysoul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourselffrom her?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the oldmarsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which hadsubdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists weresolemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,smote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a littlewhile.“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast ofa boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it veryserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think ofwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This maylead to miserable things.”“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but Ican’t help it.”“You can’t detach yourself?”“No. Impossible!”“You can’t try, Handel?”“No. Impossible!”“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had beenasleep, and stirring the fire, “now I’ll endeavour to make myselfagreeable again!”So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs intheir places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, andcame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his leftleg in both arms.“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and myfather’s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father’s sonto remark that my father’s establishment is not particularly brilliantin its housekeeping.”“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I, to say somethingencouraging.“O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongestapproval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is aswell as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had notgiven matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I askyou if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your partof the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages arealways most particularly anxious to be married?”This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is itso?”“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know. Because itis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was nextme and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. LittleJane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, youmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetualcontemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has alreadymade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.”“Then you are?” said I.“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured withfurther particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of myweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.“May I ask the name?” I said.“Name of Clara,” said Herbert.“Live in London?”“Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had becomecuriously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interestingtheme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical familynotions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.I think he was a species of purser.”“What is he now?” said I.“He’s an invalid now,” replied Herbert.“Living on—?”“On the first floor,” said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,for I had intended my question to apply to his means. “I have neverseen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have knownClara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendousrows,—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.” Inlooking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the timerecovered his usual lively manner.“Don’t you expect to see him?” said I.“O yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned Herbert, “because Inever hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through theceiling. But I don’t know how long the rafters may hold.”When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and toldme that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention tomarry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,engendering low spirits, “But you _can’t_ marry, you know, while you’relooking about you.”As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult visionto realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in mypockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting myattention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had receivedfrom Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscianrenown. “And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it’sto-night!”This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolveto go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abetHerbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticablemeans, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew meby reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we hadwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out ourcandles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in questof Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.Chapter XXXI.On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that countryelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. Thewhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a nobleboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peerwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late inlife, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair ofwhite silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. Mygifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I couldhave wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.Several curious little circumstances transpired as the actionproceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have beentroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken itwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantomalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it hadthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air ofanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which weresuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which ledto the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—arecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be notedof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air ofhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, itperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned itsterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxomlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the publicto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diademby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), herwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, sothat she was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy inthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it werein one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, aclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Courtfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nicediscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to awant of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holyorders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the generalindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to suchslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken offher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man whohad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in thefront row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’shave supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated withplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question orstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; onthe question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roaredyes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “Toss up forit;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should suchfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouragedwith loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When he appeared with his stockingdisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one veryneat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flatiron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the palenessof his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost hadgiven him. On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flutethat had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at thedoor,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When herecommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,“And don’t _you_ do it, neither; you’re a deal worse than _him_!” And Igrieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one ofthese occasions.But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had theappearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiasticalwash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle ina comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out! Here’s theundertaker a coming, to see how you’re a getting on with your work!” Ibelieve it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopslecould not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass withoutthe comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in anempty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for ageneral joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among thebearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attendedMr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of theorchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled theking off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the anklesupward.We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. Ilaughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedlyfine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution,—not for old associations’ sake, I amafraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill anddownhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any naturalcircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, Isaid to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.”We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enougheither. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavysmear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when wecame up with him,—“Mr. Pip and friend?”Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.“Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man, “would be glad to have the honour.”“Waldengarver?” I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, “ProbablyWopsle.”“Oh!” said I. “Yes. Shall we follow you?”“A few steps, please.” When we were in a side alley, he turned andasked, “How did you think he looked?—I dressed him.”I don’t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with theaddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blueribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in someextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.“When he come to the grave,” said our conductor, “he showed his cloakbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he seethe ghost in the queen’s apartment, he might have made more of hisstockings.”I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopslewas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was justroom for us to look at him over one another’s shoulders, by keeping thepacking-case door, or lid, wide open.“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you informer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever beenacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying toget himself out of his princely sables.“Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,” said the owner of thatproperty, “or you’ll bust ’em. Bust ’em, and you’ll bustfive-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with afiner pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave ’em to me.”With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen overbackward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,—“Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), “Capitally.” SoI said “Capitally.”“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?” said Mr.Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.Herbert said from behind (again poking me), “Massive and concrete.” SoI said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist uponit, “Massive and concrete.”“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver,with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wallat the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.“But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man who wason his knees, “in which you’re out in your reading. Now mind! I don’tcare who says contrairy; I tell you so. You’re out in your reading ofHamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him toput a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, andwhenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don’tsee no wafers!” And at night his reading was lovely.”Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithfulDependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is alittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,they will improve.”Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.“Did you observe, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, “that there was aman in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,—Imean, the representation?”We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. Iadded, “He was drunk, no doubt.”“O dear no, sir,” said Mr. Wopsle, “not drunk. His employer would seeto that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.”“You know his employer?” said I.Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing bothceremonies very slowly. “You must have observed, gentlemen,” said he,“an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenanceexpressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not saysustained—the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, Kingof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!”Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry forMr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces puton,—which jostled us out at the doorway,—to ask Herbert what he thoughtof having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kindto do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard’s with us,wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat untiltwo o’clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing hisplans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a generalrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to endwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereftand without a chance or hope.Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and thatI had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert’s Clara, or play Hamlet toMiss Havisham’s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowingtwenty words of it.Chapter XXXII.One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a noteby the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:—“I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. Ibelieve it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havishamhas that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you herregard.“Yours, ESTELLA.”If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits ofclothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to becontent with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew nopeace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought meeither; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting thecoach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left theBlue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I stillfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sightlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason Ihad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours,when Wemmick ran against me.“Halloa, Mr. Pip,” said he; “how do you do? I should hardly havethought this was _your_ beat.”I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up bycoach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.“Both flourishing thankye,” said Wemmick, “and particularly the Aged.He’s in wonderful feather. He’ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have anotion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighbourhood shouldn’tcomplain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?”“To the office?” said I, for he was tending in that direction.“Next thing to it,” returned Wemmick, “I am going to Newgate. We are ina banker’s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the roadtaking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a wordor two with our client.”“Did your client commit the robbery?” I asked.“Bless your soul and body, no,” answered Wemmick, very drily. “But heis accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accusedof it, you know.”“Only neither of us is,” I remarked.“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;“you’re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?Have you time to spare?”I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep myeye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquirywhether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, andascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to thetrying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could beexpected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoinedMr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised bythe information I had received, accepted his offer.We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodgewhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prisonrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were muchneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on allpublic wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longestpunishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed betterthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to theirprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of theirsoup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman wasgoing his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,disorderly, depressing scene it was.It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardenermight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by hisseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What,Captain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that BlackBill behind the cistern? Why I didn’t look for you these two months;how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars andattending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with hispost-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar departmentof Mr. Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggershung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. Hispersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with bothhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands inhis pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respectingthe raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possiblefrom the insufficient money produced, said, “it’s no use, my boy. I’monly a subordinate. I can’t take it. Don’t go on in that way with asubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you hadbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principalsin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,may be worth the while of another; that’s my recommendation to you,speaking as a subordinate. Don’t try on useless measures. Why shouldyou? Now, who’s next?”Thus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned to me andsaid, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so,without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can seenow, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with apeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes thatwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner ofthe bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fattysurface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose militarysalute.“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was toostrong for us, Colonel.”“Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but _I_ don’t care.”“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “_you_ don’t care.” Then, turning tome, “Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and boughthis discharge.”I said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then looked overmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand acrosshis lips and laughed.“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick.“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,”said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. “Same to you,Colonel.”“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said theman, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favour ofyour wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By the by; you werequite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky. “I am told youhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friendof yours to bring me a pair, if you’ve no further use for ’em?”“It shall be done, sir.”“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.Good-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as wewalked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman. TheRecorder’s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed onMonday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons areportable property all the same.” With that, he looked back, and noddedat this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out ofthe yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in itsplace.As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the greatimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less thanby those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said theturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr.Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make itmanslaughter, or what’s he going to make of it?”“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick.“O yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.“Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick,turning to me with his post-office elongated. “They don’t mind whatthey ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch ’em asking anyquestions of my principal.”“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones of youroffice?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s humour.“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so! Asksanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr.Jaggers is.”“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in afacetious way, “you’re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to dowith my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I’llget him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at usover the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into thestreet.“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my armto be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a betterthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He’s always sohigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.That Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durstask him his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height andthem, he slips in his subordinate,—don’t you see?—and so he has ’em,soul and body.”I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian’ssubtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for thefirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, wheresuppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, andI returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with somethree hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strangeit was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison andcrime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winterevening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should havereappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was fadedbut not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune andadvancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautifulyoung Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought withabsolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wishedthat Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gonewith him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might nothave had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dustoff my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, andI was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’sconservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her handwaving to me.What _was_ the nameless shadow which again in that one instant hadpassed?Chapter XXXIII.In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicatelybeautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner wasmore winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and Ithought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change.We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, andwhen it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything butherself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination.“I am going to Richmond,” she told me. “Our lesson is, that there aretwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is theSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my chargesout of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our owndevices, you and I.”As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an innermeaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not withdispleasure.“A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here alittle?”“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and youare to take care of me the while.”She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested awaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seensuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which hecouldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of theestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluousarticle, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,and somebody’s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took usinto another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate ascorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having lookedat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;which, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out ofthe room in a very low state of mind.I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strongcombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer thatthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprisingproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought thatwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at allhappy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady there,who has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducingme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”“Yes, I suppose so.”She answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as ifyou were some one else.”“Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,” said Estella,smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?”“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—” It appeared to me that I waslosing a chance.“At least?” repeated Estella.“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk suchnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the restof his family?”“Very superior indeed. He is nobody’s enemy—”“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class ofman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy andspite, I have heard?”“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” saidEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at oncegrave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports andinsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the tormentand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourselfthe hatred those people feel for you.”“They do me no harm, I hope?”Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was verysingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. Whenshe left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with realenjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her,—“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me anyharm.”“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Estella. “You may be certainthat I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, andthe tortures they undergo!” She laughed again, and even now when shehad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could notdoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. Ithought there must really be something more here than I knew; she sawthe thought in my mind, and answered it.“It is not easy for even you.” said Estella, “to know what satisfactionit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense ofthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were notbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had notyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressedand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not thatis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your roundchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of awoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes upin the night. I did.”It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning theseremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause ofthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella. “First, notwithstanding theproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set yourmind at rest that these people never will—never would in a hundredyears—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, greator small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being sobusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”As she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been butmomentary—I held it and put it to my lips. “You ridiculous boy,” saidEstella, “will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in thesame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”“What spirit was that?” said I.“I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners andplotters.”“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”“You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if youlike.”I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s. “Now,” saidEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to takecare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in ourintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went onagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So italways was.I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but oftea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives andforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meeklittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong ironcover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in aquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proofimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits ofbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered inwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After aprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length cameback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These Isteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliancesextracted one cup of I don’t know what for Estella.The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the wholehouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’spurse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away.Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soonunder the walls of which I was so ashamed.“What place is that?” Estella asked me.I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then toldher. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,“Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for anyconsideration.“Mr. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,“has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal placethan any man in London.”“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in alow voice.“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since Ican remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I couldspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance withhim?”“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done verywell.”“Are you intimate?”“I have dined with him at his private house.”“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”“It is a curious place.”I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even withher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describethe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a suddenglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alivewith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were outof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been inlightning.So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way bywhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on thisside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, shetold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until shehad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then ingoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of herwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said “God forbid!”and no more.It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the taskhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if shehad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I shouldhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully choseto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her tocrush it and throw it away.When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. MatthewPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that Ihoped I should see her sometimes.“O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; youare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?“No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady ofsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.”“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, witha sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and seeher regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they arenearly all mine now.”It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course shedid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a houseby the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had theircourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were stillcut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs andstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession ofthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and gothe silent way of the rest.A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said tothe house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hiltedsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—soundedgravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came flutteringout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and shegave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbedlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy Ishould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happywith her, but always miserable.I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got inwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At ourown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little partyescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spiteof his being subject to Flopson.Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer ondomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children andservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. ButMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account ofthe baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep himquiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the FootGuards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could beregarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years eitherto apply externally or to take as a tonic.Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practicaladvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and ahighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begginghim to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket asshe sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as asovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn’t.Chapter XXXIV.As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun tonotice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence onmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state ofchronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience wasnot by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in thenight,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen MissHavisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners withJoe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I satalone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire likethe forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet ofmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own partin its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to mysatisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning theinfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and soI perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial toanybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. Mylavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could notafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peacewith anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for havingunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poorarts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left themslumbering. But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it oftencaused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service incrowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholsterywork, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I beganto contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert mustbegin too, so he soon followed. At Startop’s suggestion, we putourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of theGrove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it werenot that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, toquarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to causesix waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifyingsocial ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and Iunderstood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toastof the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of goodfeeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was inCovent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour ofjoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering abouttown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the postsat the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of hisequipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasiondeliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—likecoals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and couldnot be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came ofage.In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have takenHerbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could makeno such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in everydirection, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell intokeeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about himwith a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look abouthim more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came intodinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, ratherclearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towardsmidnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became sodeeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going toAmerica, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make hisfortune.I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was atHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbertwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at thoseseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception thatthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in thegeneral tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grewgreyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities bythe hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us abouther grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting itinto bed whenever it attracted her notice.As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object ofclearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at oncecompleting the description of our usual manners and customs atBarnard’s Inn.We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as peoplecould make up their minds to give us. We were always more or lessmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoyingourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of mybelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to lookabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which heconsorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, analmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that Iever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what weundertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in aRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, exceptat a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observanceof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anythingelse in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come backagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positivelymust find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walkin and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among theassembled magnates. “For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner onone of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, thatan opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hatedone another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyondexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sightof the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a lessremunerative appearance then than at any other time in thefour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfastbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion atbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “notunwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,”I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake himoff his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a bootedCupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on ourhumour—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if youwill believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strangecoincidence.”“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment forthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way toconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. AndI know Herbert thought so too.We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle ofsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our mindsmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to themark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply ofink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there wassomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, ina neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts”; with Barnard’sInn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheetof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum ofHerbert’s debts.”Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, halfburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, andotherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed usexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult todistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actuallypaying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two thingsseemed about equal.When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most ruefulmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, theyare mounting up.”“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with greatassiduity. “Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Starethem out of countenance.”“So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.”However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert wouldfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on theplea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or Nobbs’s, as thecase might be.“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put itdown.”“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, withadmiration. “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, thereputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilitiesdown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. Myself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetricalbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had notmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs intoa focus for him.My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called“leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be onehundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave amargin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to befour times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at sevenhundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to havebeen an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense offreedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into anothermargin.But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on theseexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirableopinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’scompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on thetable before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of somesort, rather than a private individual.We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that wemight not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state oneevening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the saiddoor, and fall on the ground. “It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing thematter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that Iwas an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes pastsix in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at theinterment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon.Chapter XXXV.It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, andthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of mysister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. Thatthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemedunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in mythoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was comingtowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at thedoor. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion ofthe sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if shewere still alive and had been often there.Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled mysister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regretwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (andperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seizedwith a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she hadsuffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could haverevengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him thatI would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in thecurious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in themorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to theforge.It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the timeswhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them thatsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of thebeans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when itwould be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine shouldbe softened as they thought of me.At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismallyabsurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in ablack bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate anycomfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them Irecognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a youngcouple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence ofintoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse claspedround the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, andmost of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closedwindows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the twowarders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far toomuch exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for awager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leavesup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantityof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finishedputting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;so he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, andconfused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony ofwarm affection.Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bowunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bentdown and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap,you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my handand said no more.Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietlyhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as Ithought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, andthere began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, Ilooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visibleuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plumcake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, andbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but hadnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechookin a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternatelystuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch myattention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathingsherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” anddid. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decentspeechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to “follow,” andwere all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) intoridiculous bundles.“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.Trabb called “formed” in the parlour, two and two,—and it wasdreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which Imeantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to thechurch myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to itwith willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbourswould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting inrespect.”“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in adepressed business-like voice. “Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We areready!”So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noseswere bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy andPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister hadbeen brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point ofUndertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blindedunder a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the wholelooked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling andblundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy andhis comrade.The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, andwe were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthfuland vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut usoff, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At suchtimes the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner onour emergence round some corner of expectancy, “_Here_ they come!”“_Here_ they are!” and we were all but cheered. In this progress I wasmuch annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persistedall the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by theexcessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceitedand vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of theships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of thisparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister waslaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and thelight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that evenwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how itbrought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how itfleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard himcough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who cameunexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had thehardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I haddone her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered itreasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drankall the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the twotalked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) asif they were of quite another race from the deceased, and werenotoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the JollyBargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliestbenefactor.When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his Boy; Ilooked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had acold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the oldkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with hisknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was greatrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, andwhen I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat downtogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. Inoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as tomake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in whichthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own littleroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a greatthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closingin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for alittle talk.“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sadmatters.”“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had thoughtthat.”“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I considerthat you ought to have thought that.”“Do you, Mr. Pip?”She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way withher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. Afterlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gaveup that point.“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddydear?”“Oh! I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but stillof quiet conviction. “I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I amgoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care ofMr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”“How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—”“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentaryflush upon her face. “I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to getthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can bewell recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industriousand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,”pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “thenew schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from youafter that time, and have had time since then to improve.”“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”“Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little furtherwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”“They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her badstates—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for fourdays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, andsaid quite plainly, ‘Joe.’ As she had never said any word for a longwhile, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signsto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me toput her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laidher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so shepresently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and once ‘Pip.’ And soshe never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour laterwhen we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars thatwere coming out, were blurred in my own sight.“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”“Nothing.”“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”“I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working inthe quarries.”“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that darktree in the lane?”“I saw him there, on the night she died.”“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is ofno use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for runningout, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, andhe is gone.”It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued bythis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and toldher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out ofthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and shetold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,—shedidn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,—but ever didhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and agentle heart.“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy,we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be oftendown here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”Biddy said never a single word.“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”“Yes, Mr. Pip.”“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be inbad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must requestto know what you mean by this?”“By this?” said Biddy.“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted. “You used not to echo, Biddy.”“Used not!” said Biddy. “O Mr. Pip! Used!”Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After anothersilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have thegoodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?” askedBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under thestars with a clear and honest eye.“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy indespair. “This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don’t say anymore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.”For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, andwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave ofher as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with thechurchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in thenight, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what anunkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, andlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There Istood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow ofhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the brightsun of the life in store for him were shining on it.“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don’t wipe it off—for God’s sake, give me yourblackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often.”[Illustration]“Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milkand a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand atparting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me behurt, if I have been ungenerous.”Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed tome, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and thatBiddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.Chapter XXXVI.Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing ourdebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the likeexemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has away of doing; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Herbert’s prediction,that I should do so before I knew where I was.Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he hadnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make aprofound sensation in Barnard’s Inn. But we had looked forward to myone-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations andanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardlyhelp saying something definite on that occasion.I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when mybirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note fromWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would callupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convincedus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusualflutter when I repaired to my guardian’s office, a model ofpunctuality.In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, andincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece oftissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respectingit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian’s room. It wasNovember, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his backagainst the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.“Well, Pip,” said he, “I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,Mr. Pip.”We shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thankedhim.“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at hisboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old timewhen I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on theshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they weremaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in thebox, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”“If you please, sir.”“What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at theground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—“whatdo you suppose you are living at the rate of?”“At the rate of, sir?”“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,“the—rate—of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with hispocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyedany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This replyseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew hisnose with an air of satisfaction.“Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.“Have you anything to ask _me_?”“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you severalquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”“Ask one,” said Mr. Jaggers.“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?”“No. Ask another.”“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape fromthe inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggerssaid, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called toWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed itin, and disappeared.“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “attend, if you please. You have beendrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick’scash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”“I am afraid I must say yes, sir.”“You know you must say yes; don’t you?” said Mr. Jaggers.“Yes, sir.”“I don’t ask you what you owe, because you don’t know; and if you didknow, you wouldn’t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,”cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show ofprotesting: “it’s likely enough that you think you wouldn’t, but youwould. You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take thispiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold itand tell me what it is.”“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, “for five hundred pounds.And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?”“How could I do otherwise!”“Ah! But answer the question,” said Mr. Jaggers.“Undoubtedly.”“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, thathandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on thisday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsomesum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live untilthe donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take yourmoney affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw fromWemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you arein communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mereagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute myinstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, butI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the greatliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. “I amnot paid, Pip,” said he, coolly, “to carry your words to any one;” andthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, andstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs againsthim.After a pause, I hinted,—“There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me towaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking itagain?”“What is it?” said he.I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took meaback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, thefountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there Idelicately stopped.“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers. “That’s no question as it stands,you know.”“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a preciseform of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”“Now, here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with hisdark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we firstencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,Pip?”“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when thatperson appeared.”“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers, “that’s my answer.”As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in mystrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it camequicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that Ihad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”Mr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question, but inaltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answerit,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when myeyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in theirsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backsof his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That’s aquestion I must not be asked. You’ll understand that better, when Itell you it’s a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I’ll go alittle further with you; I’ll say something more.”He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub thecalves of his legs in the pause he made.“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,“you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that persondiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When thatperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anythingabout it. And that’s all I have got to say.”We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and lookedthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notionthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken himinto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that heresented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really didobject to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When Iraised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at meall the time, and was doing so still.“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can benothing left for me to say.”He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked mewhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with hiscompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted onwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparationfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) hadhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talkto Wemmick.The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into mypocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often therebefore; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advisewith concerning such thought.He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for goinghome. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy officecandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab nearthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put hishat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chestwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.“Mr. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirousto serve a friend.”Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinionwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, buthas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make abeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.“With _some_ money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shotacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with _some_money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”“Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on myfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high asChelsea Reach. Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark, two;Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.”He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of hissafe-key on the palm of his hand. “There’s as many as six, you see, tochoose from.”“I don’t understand you,” said I.“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk uponyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre archof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, andyou may know the end of it too,—but it’s a less pleasant and profitableend.”I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide aftersaying this.“This is very discouraging,” said I.“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation,“that a man should never—”“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick. “Certainly heshould not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,—and then itbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to getrid of him.”“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loopholehere; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and thisoffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers isanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentimentsmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be takenin this office.”“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up atWalworth, you may depend upon it.”“Mr. Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private andpersonal capacity.”We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing myguardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared inhis doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat andstood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the streettogether, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.Jaggers and I turned ours.I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggershad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or aSomebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortableconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at allseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as hemade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer thanWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick todinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyesfixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony andforgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.Chapter XXXVII.Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworthsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimageto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the UnionJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show ofdefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a mostpacific manner by the Aged.“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “ratherhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left wordthat he would soon be home from his afternoon’s walk. He is veryregular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is myson.”I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, andwe went in and sat down by the fireside.“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in hischirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his office, Iexpect?” I nodded. “Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful handat his business, sir?” I nodded hard. “Yes; so they tell me. Hisbusiness is the Law?” I nodded harder. “Which makes it more surprisingin my son,” said the old man, “for he was not brought up to the Law,but to the Wine-Coopering.”Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning thereputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me intothe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a verysprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.” And to this hour Ihave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought Ihad made.As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without makingsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether hisown calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of strainingthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman onthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making mymeaning understood.“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing. First,over yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe heintended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of Londonhere. However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—”I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son hewent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little andlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning towhat you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,“what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabledme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as thisimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wallon one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a littlewooden flap with “JOHN” upon it. The old man, following my eyes, criedwith great triumph, “My son’s come home!” and we both went out to thedrawbridge.It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from theother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it withthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick hadcome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom hewas accompanied.Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, inthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two orthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessedof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, bothbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I mighthave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her glovesa little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort offellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long indiscovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on ourgoing in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance forannouncing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for amoment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presentlyanother click came, and another little door tumbled open with “MissSkiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; thenMiss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut uptogether. On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances,I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and hesaid, “Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.And by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all thepeople who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only knownto the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his own handsout of his own head.”While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her greengloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there wascompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round theproperty, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that hedid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, Iseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if Ihad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious inbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and howwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, andat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I hadderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and Iconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he mighthave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havishamin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at thepossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at thecertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above anymean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I toldWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had agreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect somerays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experienceand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with myresources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred ayear, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him onto some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, tounderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’sknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the worldwith whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon hisshoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know itmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having everbrought me here.”Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind ofstart, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This isdevilish good of you.”“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I.“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my trade.”“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.“You are right,” he returned. “You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,I’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may bedone by degrees. Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant andagent. I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”“I thank you ten thousand times.”“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly inour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returnedinto the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. Theresponsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, andthat excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to mein some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we weregoing to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such ahay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it asit simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while MissSkiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premisesbecame strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire toparticipate in the entertainment.The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the rightmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworthas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbedthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open ofJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to somespasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until Igot used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of MissSkiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; andI rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing theprofile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a verynew moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her byWemmick.We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it wasdelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Agedespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savagetribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in theabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom ofher family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a triflinglady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put onher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now,Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, thatthis was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentlemaninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won’t offer anapology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—areyou, Aged P.?”“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himselfspoken to.“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,”said Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,Aged One.”“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man, so busyand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’sgreat-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to comethrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he wasalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper intothem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick wasequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we allexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until heresumed again.As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in ashadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and graduallystealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist. In course of time I sawhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that momentMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his armagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatestdeliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins’s composurewhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have everseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstractionof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed itmechanically.By and by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, andgradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began towiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quiteenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other sideof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatnessof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laidit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I amjustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading,Wemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalledto it by Miss Skiffins.At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the timefor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a blackbottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clericaldignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of theseappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, whowas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she andWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offerto see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I hadbest go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, andhaving passed a pleasant evening.Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matterappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he wouldbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out toWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him byappointment in the City several times, but never held any communicationwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, thatwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not longestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wantedcapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want apartner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of whichHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred poundsdown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due atcertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into myproperty. Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmickpervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not theleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget theradiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as amighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (theyoung merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown anextraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that theopening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and hisface brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionatefriend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears oftriumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, andhe having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked tome for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did reallycry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectationshad done some good to somebody.A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on myview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to allthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is notmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.Chapter XXXVIII.If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come tobe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. Othe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit withinme haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where itwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about thathouse.The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was awidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The motherlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion waspink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a goodposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, butthe understanding was established that they were necessary to her, andthat she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of MissHavisham’s before the time of her seclusion.In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I sufferedevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. Thenature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms offamiliarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to mydistraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turnedthe very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting aconstant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brotherof her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself furtherfrom my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling herby her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under thecircumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likelythat it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that italmost maddened me.She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer ofevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of themwithout that.I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I usedoften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,through which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me. I neverhad one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round thefour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her withme unto death.Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as willpresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habituallyreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forcedupon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden checkin this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we satapart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you nevertake warning?”“Of what?”“Of me.”“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”“Do I mean! If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for thereason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of mymiseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. Mydread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavydisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebelliousstruggle in her bosom.“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for youwrote to me to come to you, this time.”“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that alwayschilled me.After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went onto say:—“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a dayat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. Shewould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Canyou take me?”“Can I take you, Estella!”“You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to payall charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?”“And must obey,” said I.This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for otherslike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much asseen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and wefound her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needlessto add that there was no change in Satis House.She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when Ilast saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there wassomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.She hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon hergestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she lookedat her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she hadreared.From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed topry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How does she use you, Pip; howdoes she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,even in Estella’s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire atnight, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawnthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, bydint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regularletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mindmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutchstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, avery spectre.I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense ofdependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this thatEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that shewas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I sawin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending herout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her withthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw inthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, evenwhile the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for mybeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian’sdeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and therebefore my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw inthis, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in whichher life was hidden from the sun.The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces onthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with thesteady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As Ilooked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at thestopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon thetable and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostlyreflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, Isaw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeatedand thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room acrossthe landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as itwere, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in thecrawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice asthey betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in thegropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arosebetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had everseen them opposed.We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havishamstill had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutchedEstella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had ratherendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you tiredof me?”“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Estella, disengaging her arm,and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down atthe fire.“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Miss Havisham, passionatelystriking her stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down atthe fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed aself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that wasalmost cruel.“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “You cold, cold heart!”“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as sheleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “doyou reproach me for being cold? You?”“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.“You should know,” said Estella. “I am what you have made me. Take allthe praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all thefailure; in short, take me.”“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look ather so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where Itook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from itsstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!”[Illustration]“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I couldwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. Butwhat would you have? You have been very good to me, and I oweeverything to you. What would you have?”“Love,” replied the other.“You have it.”“I have not,” said Miss Havisham.“Mother by adoption,” retorted Estella, never departing from the easygrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, neveryielding either to anger or tenderness,—“mother by adoption, I havesaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. Allthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that,I have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”“Did I never give her love!” cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.“Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at alltimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her callme mad, let her call me mad!”“Why should I call you mad,” returned Estella, “I, of all people? Doesany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as Ido? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half aswell as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stoolthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking upinto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!”“Soon forgotten!” moaned Miss Havisham. “Times soon forgotten!”“No, not forgotten,” retorted Estella,—“not forgotten, but treasured upin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When haveyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me givingadmission here,” she touched her bosom with her hand, “to anything thatyou excluded? Be just to me.”“So proud, so proud!” moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hairwith both her hands.“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Estella. “Who praised me when Ilearnt my lesson?”“So hard, so hard!” moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Estella. “Who praised me when Ilearnt my lesson?”“But to be proud and hard to _me_!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked, asshe stretched out her arms. “Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud andhard to _me_!”Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but wasnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down atthe fire again.“I cannot think,” said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence “whyyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after aseparation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I havenever been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown anyweakness that I can charge myself with.”“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “Butyes, yes, she would call it so!”“I begin to think,” said Estella, in a musing way, after another momentof calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes about. If youhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement ofthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing asthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,—if you haddone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand thedaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed andangry?”Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.“Or,” said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be herenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it hadblighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and shecould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see herface), but still made no answer.“So,” said Estella, “I must be taken as I have been made. The successis not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.”Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I tookadvantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave theroom, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement ofmy hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the greatchimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham’s greyhair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, andwas a miserable sight to see.It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for anhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and aboutthe ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, Ifound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitchesin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, andof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of oldbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estellaand I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and playedFrench games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the firsttime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused tocome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on thisside of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behindthe half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in theroom overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the nightwas slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutelycould no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that Imust get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went outacross the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain theouter courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was nosooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw MissHavisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. Ifollowed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. Shecarried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken fromone of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object byits light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewedair of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heardher walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across againinto that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the darkboth to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until somestreaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. Duringthe whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, Iheard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaselesslow cry.Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference betweenher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; andthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,did Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in anywise change, exceptthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its formercharacteristics.It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting BentleyDrummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, andwhen good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’sagreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove toorder, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’sturn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at mewhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lostbetween us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise whenhe called upon the company to pledge him to “Estella!”“Estella who?” said I.“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.“Estella of where?” said I. “You are bound to say of where.” Which hewas, as a Finch.“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question,“and a peerless beauty.”Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! Iwhispered Herbert.“I know that lady,” said Herbert, across the table, when the toast hadbeen honoured.“_Do_ you?” said Drummle.“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.“_Do_ you?” said Drummle. “_O_, Lord!”This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavycreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by itas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my placeand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourableFinch’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked aboutcoming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn ofexpression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knewnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant bythat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knewwhere I was to be found.Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. Thedebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six morehonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that theybelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it wasdecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummlewould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing thathe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmthwhich.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honourshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with apolite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honour ofdancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regretthat I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole torepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while theGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally thepromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazingrate.I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannotadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella shouldshow any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very farbelow the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have beenreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in mylove for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping tothat hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she hadfavoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kindand degree of distress.It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummlehad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. Alittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossedone another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, andEstella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing himvery well, now scarcely remembering who he was.The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had ablockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, whichsometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place ofconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watchingEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoilhimself and drop at the right nick of time.At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Ballsat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much tolerationon her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took thenext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley totake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. Iwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from suchplaces.“Are you tired, Estella?”“Rather, Pip.”“You should be.”“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House towrite, before I go to sleep.”“Recounting to-night’s triumph?” said I. “Surely a very poor one,Estella.”“What do you mean? I didn’t know there had been any.”“Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who islooking over here at us.”“Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on meinstead. “What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to useyour words,—that I need look at?”“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I. “For hehas been hovering about you all night.”“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Estella, with aglance towards him, “hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle helpit?”“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”“Well!” said she, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps. Yes. Anything youlike.”“But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you shouldencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he isdespised.”“Well?” said she.“You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”“Well?” said she.“You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculousroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don’t you?”“Well?” said she again; and each time she said it, she opened herlovely eyes the wider.To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took itfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well! Then, that iswhy it makes me wretched.”Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any ideaof making me—me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of thequestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.“Pip,” said Estella, casting her glance over the room, “don’t befoolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, andmay be meant to have. It’s not worth discussing.”“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say,‘she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowestin the crowd.’”“I can bear it,” said Estella.“Oh! don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.”“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Estella, openingher hands. “And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to aboor!”“There is no doubt you do,” said I, something hurriedly, “for I haveseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you nevergive to—me.”“Do you want me then,” said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed andserious, if not angry, look, “to deceive and entrap you?”“Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?”“Yes, and many others,—all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I’llsay no more.”And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filledmy heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass onunhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; theevent that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the worldheld Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receivingits first distortions from Miss Havisham’s wasting hands.In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed ofstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry,the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carriedthrough the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted inthe roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles ofhollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labour,and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, andthe sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ringwas put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted andrushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, nearand afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in aninstant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped uponme.Chapter XXXIX.I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard toenlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-thirdbirthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year,and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by theriver.Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our originalrelations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding myinability to settle to anything,—which I hope arose out of the restlessand incomplete tenure on which I held my means,—I had a taste forreading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter ofHerbert’s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I havebrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, andhad a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hopingthat to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed,I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had beendriving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in theEast there were an eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been thegusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off theirroofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails ofwindmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast,of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied theserages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had beenthe worst of all.Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it soexposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and thewind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like dischargesof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashedagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though itcould not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doorsopen and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the blackwindows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in theteeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court wereblown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore wereshuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were beingcarried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book ateleven o’clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul’s, and all the manychurch-clocks in the City—some leading, some accompanying, somefollowing—struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,when I heard a footstep on the stair.What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with thefootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and Ilistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took upmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below hadstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, lookingdown.“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.“What floor do you want?”“The top. Mr. Pip.”“That is my name.—There is nothing the matter?”“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice. And the man came on.I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowlywithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and itscircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mereinstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that wasstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touchedand pleased by the sight of me.Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantiallydressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-greyhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strongon his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure toweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lampincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he washolding out both his hands to me.“Pray what is your business?” I asked him.“My business?” he repeated, pausing. “Ah! Yes. I will explain mybusiness, by your leave.”“Do you wish to come in?”“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, master.”I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented thesort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me torespond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could toexplain himself.He looked about him with the strangest air,—an air of wonderingpleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,—and hepulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his headwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only onits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On thecontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his handsto me.“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting him to be mad.He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand overhis head. “It’s disapinting to a man,” he said, in a coarse brokenvoice, “arter having looked for’ard so distant, and come so fur; butyou’re not to blame for that,—neither on us is to blame for that. I’llspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.”He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered hisforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at himattentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not knowhim.“There’s no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder; “is there?”“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,ask that question?” said I.“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with adeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and mostexasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one! But don’t catchhold of me. You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.”I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yetI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind andthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all theintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we firststood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known myconvict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chairbefore the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it tome; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it roundhis head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take ashivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. Iknew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before,I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Notknowing what to do,—for, in my astonishment I had lost myself-possession,—I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped themheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.“You acted noble, my boy,” said he. “Noble, Pip! And I have neverforgot it!”At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, Ilaid a hand upon his breast and put him away.“Stay!” said I. “Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I didwhen I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude bymending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was notnecessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must besomething good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will notrepulse you; but surely you must understand that—I—”My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look atme, that the words died away on my tongue.“You was a-saying,” he observed, when we had confronted one another insilence, “that surely I must understand. What, surely must Iunderstand?”“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of longago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you haverepented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am gladthat, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. Butour ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you lookweary. Will you drink something before you go?”He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenlyobservant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” he answered, stillwith the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I _will_drink (I thank you) afore I go.”There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table nearthe fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of thebottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rumand water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his lookat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of hisneckerchief between his teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand verydifficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw withamazement that his eyes were full of tears.Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wishedhim gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, andfelt a touch of reproach. “I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting somethinginto a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that youwill not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention ofdoing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!”As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end ofhis neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, andstretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drewhis sleeve across his eyes and forehead.“How are you living?” I asked him.“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away inthe new world,” said he; “many a thousand mile of stormy water off fromthis.”“I hope you have done well?”“I’ve done wonderfully well. There’s others went out alonger me as hasdone well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I’m famous forit.”“I am glad to hear it.”“I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.”Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in whichthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into mymind.“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,“since he undertook that trust?”“Never set eyes upon him. I warn’t likely to it.”“He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was apoor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a littlefortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me paythem back. You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.” I took outmy purse.He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and hewatched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. Theywere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded themlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and droppedthe ashes into the tray.“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you _how_ you have donewell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?”“How?”“Ah!”He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, withhis heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neitherlooked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was onlynow that I began to tremble.When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were withoutsound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do itdistinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said he.I faltered, “I don’t know.”“Might a mere warmint ask whose property?” said he.I faltered again, “I don’t know.”“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your incomesince you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?”With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I roseout of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, lookingwildly at him.“Concerning a guardian,” he went on. “There ought to have been someguardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. Asto the first letter of that lawyer’s name now. Would it be J?”All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and itsdisappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushedin in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had tostruggle for every breath I drew.“Put it,” he resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name begunwith a J, and might be Jaggers,—put it as he had come over sea toPortsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.‘However, you have found me out,’ you says just now. Well! However, didI find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, forparticulars of your address. That person’s name? Why, Wemmick.”I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. Istood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where Iseemed to be suffocating,—I stood so, looking wildly at him, until Igrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caughtme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent onone knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, andthat I shuddered at, very near to mine.“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman on you! It’s me wot has doneit! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guineashould go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec’lated and gotrich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;I worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do Itell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you toknow as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got hishead so high that he could make a gentleman,—and, Pip, you’re him!”The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, therepugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceededif he had been some terrible beast.“Look’ee here, Pip. I’m your second father. You’re my son,—more to menor any son. I’ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was ahired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces ofsheep till I half forgot wot men’s and women’s faces wos like, I seeyourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating mydinner or my supper, and I says, ‘Here’s the boy again, a looking at mewhiles I eats and drinks!’ I see you there a many times, as plain asever I see you on them misty marshes. ‘Lord strike me dead!’ I sayseach time,—and I goes out in the air to say it under the openheavens,—‘but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I’ll make that boy agentleman!’ And I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at thesehere lodgings of yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall showmoney with lords for wagers, and beat ’em!”In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearlyfainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the onegrain of relief I had.“Look’ee here!” he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, andturning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from histouch as if he had been a snake, “a gold ’un and a beauty: _that’s_ agentleman’s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; _that’s_ agentleman’s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look atyour clothes; better ain’t to be got! And your books too,” turning hiseyes round the room, “mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! Andyou read ’em; don’t you? I see you’d been a reading of ’em when I comein. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read ’em to me, dear boy! And if they’re inforeign languages wot I don’t understand, I shall be just as proud asif I did.”Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my bloodran cold within me.“Don’t you mind talking, Pip,” said he, after again drawing his sleeveover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which Iwell remembered,—and he was all the more horrible to me that he was somuch in earnest; “you can’t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. Youain’t looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn’t prepared forthis as I wos. But didn’t you never think it might be me?”“O no, no, no,” I returned, “Never, never!”“Well, you see it _wos_ me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it butmy own self and Mr. Jaggers.”“Was there no one else?” I asked.“No,” said he, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there be?And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There’s bright eyessomewheres—eh? Isn’t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love thethoughts on?”O Estella, Estella!“They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy ’em. Not that agentleman like you, so well set up as you, can’t win ’em off of his owngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got moneyleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and gotmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, Iwent for you. ‘Lord strike a blight upon it,’ I says, wotever it was Iwent for, ‘if it ain’t for him!’ It all prospered wonderful. As I giv’you to understand just now, I’m famous for it. It was the money leftme, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr.Jaggers—all for you—when he first come arter you, agreeable to myletter.”O that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,—far fromcontented, yet, by comparison happy!“And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look’ee here, to knowin secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of themcolonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do Isay? I says to myself, ‘I’m making a better gentleman nor ever _you_’llbe!’ When one of ’em says to another, ‘He was a convict, a few yearago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he’s lucky,’ what doI say? I says to myself, ‘If I ain’t a gentleman, nor yet ain’t got nolearning, I’m the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; whichon you owns a brought-up London gentleman?’ This way I kep myselfa-going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would forcertain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, onhis own ground.”He laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that foranything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.“It warn’t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn’tsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, forI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dearboy, I done it!”I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I hadseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, thoughthose were loud and his was silent.“Where will you put me?” he asked, presently. “I must be putsomewheres, dear boy.”“To sleep?” said I.“Yes. And to sleep long and sound,” he answered; “for I’ve beensea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.”“My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is absent;you must have his room.”“He won’t come back to-morrow; will he?”“No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmostefforts; “not to-morrow.”“Because, look’ee here, dear boy,” he said, dropping his voice, andlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution isnecessary.”“How do you mean? Caution?”“By G——, it’s Death!”“What’s death?”“I was sent for life. It’s death to come back. There’s been overmuchcoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged iftook.”Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretchedme with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life tocome to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved himinstead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by thestrongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him withthe strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary,it would have been better, for his preservation would then havenaturally and tenderly addressed my heart.My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seenfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I didso, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when Isaw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his mealagain. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, tofile at his leg.When I had gone into Herbert’s room, and had shut off any othercommunication between it and the staircase than through the room inwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go tobed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentleman’s linen” toput on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, andmy blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give megood-night.I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the firein the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid togo to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and itwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wreckedI was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.Miss Havisham’s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella notdesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, asting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart topractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the firstsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,—it was for theconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken outof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,that I had deserted Joe.I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back toBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my senseof my own worthless conduct to them was greater than everyconsideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort thatI should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I couldnever, never, undo what I had done.In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, Icould have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door.With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that Ihad had mysterious warnings of this man’s approach. That, for weeksgone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought likehis. That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming overthe sea, had drawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sentthese messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was asgood as his word, and with me.Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seenhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I hadheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him;that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wildbeast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire ahalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there withhim in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until itfilled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look atmy dreadful burden.He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set andlowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though hehad a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed thekey to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again satdown by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on thefloor. When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with theperception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches werestriking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and thewind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP’S EXPECTATIONS.Chapter XL.It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (sofar as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thoughtpressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confusedconcourse at a distance.The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers wasself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it wouldinevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my servicenow, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted byan animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a roomsecret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. Theyboth had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronicallylooking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to getup a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morningthat my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darknessfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman thereto come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the blackstaircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouchingin a corner.As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, buteluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchmanto come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The windbeing as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in thelantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but weexamined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no onethere. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might haveslipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman’s, andleaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, includingthe room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, andassuredly no other man was in those chambers.It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, onthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on thechance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram atthe door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who hadperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of thenight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived inthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other manwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been inthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in thenight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we cameupstairs.“The night being so bad, sir,” said the watchman, as he gave me back myglass, “uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them threegentlemen that I have named, I don’t call to mind another since abouteleven o’clock, when a stranger asked for you.”“My uncle,” I muttered. “Yes.”“You saw him, sir?”“Yes. Oh yes.”“Likewise the person with him?”“Person with him!” I repeated.“I judged the person to be with him,” returned the watchman. “Theperson stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the persontook this way when he took this way.”“What sort of person?”The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a workingperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind ofclothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of thematter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attachingweight to it.When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do withoutprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these twocircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocentsolution apart,—as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, whohad not gone near this watchman’s gate, might have strayed to mystaircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might havebrought some one with him to show him the way,—still, joined, they hadan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of afew hours had made me.I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time ofthe morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have beendozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full anhour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking upuneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off intoa profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, norcould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatlydejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. Asto forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed anelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wildmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when Isat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress toappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how longI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, oreven who I was that made it.At last, the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a headnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,—and testified surpriseat sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had comein the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparationswere to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while theyknocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dreamor sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waitingfor—Him—to come to breakfast.By and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself tobear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.“I do not even know,” said I, speaking low as he took his seat at thetable, “by what name to call you. I have given out that you are myuncle.”“That’s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.”“You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?”“Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.”“Do you mean to keep that name?”“Why, yes, dear boy, it’s as good as another,—unless you’d likeanother.”“What is your real name?” I asked him in a whisper.“Magwitch,” he answered, in the same tone; “chrisen’d Abel.”“What were you brought up to be?”“A warmint, dear boy.”He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted someprofession.“When you came into the Temple last night—” said I, pausing to wonderwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so longago.“Yes, dear boy?”“When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, hadyou any one with you?”“With me? No, dear boy.”“But there was some one there?”“I didn’t take particular notice,” he said, dubiously, “not knowing theways of the place. But I think there _was_ a person, too, come inalonger me.”“Are you known in London?”“I hope not!” said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger thatmade me turn hot and sick.“Were you known in London, once?”“Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.”“Were you—tried—in London?”“Which time?” said he, with a sharp look.“The last time.”He nodded. “First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.”It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up aknife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, “And what I done isworked out and paid for!” fell to at his breakfast.He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all hisactions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failedhim since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food inhis mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs tobear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begunwith any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have satmuch as I did,—repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, andgloomily looking at the cloth.“I’m a heavy grubber, dear boy,” he said, as a polite kind of apologywhen he made an end of his meal, “but I always was. If it had been inmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha’ got into lightertrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out asshepherd t’other side the world, it’s my belief I should ha’ turnedinto a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn’t a had my smoke.”As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into thebreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and ahandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Havingfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if hispocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with thetongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on thehearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favouriteaction of holding out both his hands for mine.“And this,” said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffedat his pipe,—“and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuineOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip’late, is, tostand by and look at you, dear boy!”I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginningslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I waschained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard hishoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with itsiron grey hair at the sides.“I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;there mustn’t be no mud on _his_ boots. My gentleman must have horses,Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant toride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.We’ll show ’em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won’t us?”He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting withpapers, and tossed it on the table.“There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It’syourn. All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn. Don’t you be afeerd on it.There’s more where that come from. I’ve come to the old country fur tosee my gentleman spend his money _like_ a gentleman. That’ll be _my_pleasure. _My_ pleasure ’ull be fur to see him do it. And blast youall!” he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers oncewith a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, tothe colonist a stirring up the dust, I’ll show a better gentleman thanthe whole kit on you put together!”“Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want tospeak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how youare to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, whatprojects you have.”“Look’ee here, Pip,” said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenlyaltered and subdued manner; “first of all, look’ee here. I forgotmyself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that’s what it was; low.Look’ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain’t a-going to be low.”“First,” I resumed, half groaning, “what precautions can be takenagainst your being recognised and seized?”“No, dear boy,” he said, in the same tone as before, “that don’t gofirst. Lowness goes first. I ain’t took so many year to make agentleman, not without knowing what’s due to him. Look’ee here, Pip. Iwas low; that’s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.”Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as Ireplied, “I _have_ looked over it. In Heaven’s name, don’t harp uponit!”“Yes, but look’ee here,” he persisted. “Dear boy, I ain’t come so fur,not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying—”“How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?”“Well, dear boy, the danger ain’t so great. Without I was informedagen, the danger ain’t so much to signify. There’s Jaggers, and there’sWemmick, and there’s you. Who else is there to inform?”“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?” saidI.“Well,” he returned, “there ain’t many. Nor yet I don’t intend toadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back fromBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who’s to gain by it? Still,look’ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, Ishould ha’ come to see you, mind you, just the same.”“And how long do you remain?”“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and droppinghis jaw as he stared at me. “I’m not a-going back. I’ve come for good.”“Where are you to live?” said I. “What is to be done with you? Wherewill you be safe?”“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought formoney, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and blackclothes,—shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and whatothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how ofliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.”“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious lastnight, when you swore it was Death.”“And so I swear it is Death,” said he, putting his pipe back in hismouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,and it’s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. Whatthen, when that’s once done? Here I am. To go back now ’ud be as bad asto stand ground—worse. Besides, Pip, I’m here, because I’ve meant it byyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I’m a old bird now, as hasdared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I’m notafeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there’s Death hid inside of it,there is, and let him come out, and I’ll face him, and then I’llbelieve in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at mygentleman agen.”Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air ofadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quietlodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbertreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must beconfided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if Icould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it withhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means soplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reservedhis consent to Herbert’s participation until he should have seen himand formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. “And even then,dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament outof his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath.”To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book aboutthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be tostate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I neverknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance ofhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps hisknowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in thatwise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell orcharm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how hehad made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he haddescribed himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions inhis solitude.As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which helooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I nextdiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished anextraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and hadin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made himsomething between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerabledifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like aprosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by thelaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view untilhis change of dress was made.It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in mydazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did notget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was toremain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no accountto open the door.There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in EssexStreet, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost withinhail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was sofortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. Ithen went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary tothe change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned myface, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at hisdesk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before hisfire.“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”“I will, sir,” I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of whatI was going to say.“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit any one.You understand—any one. Don’t tell me anything: I don’t want to knowanything; I am not curious.”Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what Ihave been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but atleast I may verify it.”Mr. Jaggers nodded. “But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he askedme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in alistening way at the floor. “Told would seem to imply verbalcommunication. You can’t have verbal communication with a man in NewSouth Wales, you know.”“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”“Good.”“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is thebenefactor so long unknown to me.”“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “in New South Wales.”“And only he?” said I.“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers.“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible formy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was MissHavisham.”“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon mecoolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at allresponsible for that.”“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his headand gathering up his skirts. “Take nothing on its looks; takeeverything on evidence. There’s no better rule.”“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent fora little while. “I have verified my information, and there’s an end.”“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,”said Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout mycommunication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line offact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line offact. You are quite aware of that?”“Quite, sir.”“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote tome—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever todeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to himanother caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in hisletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. Icautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at alllikely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of hisnatural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would bean act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of thelaw. I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard atme; “I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.”“No doubt,” said I.“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still lookinghard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, froma colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”“Or Provis,” I suggested.“Or Provis—thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you knowit’s Provis?”“Yes,” said I.“You know it’s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonistof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, onbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, byreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have receivedthe explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”“It came through Provis,” I replied.“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to haveseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or incommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mentionthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent toyou, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.Good-day, Pip!”We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. Iturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the twovile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have donenothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found theterrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, insafety.Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) thanwhat he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in himthat made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressedhim and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouchingfugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partlyreferable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiarto me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if therewere still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there wasConvict in the very grain of the man.The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gavehim a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were theinfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his waysof sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about ina high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn-handledjackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of liftinglight glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsypannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with itthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to makethe most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, andthen swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small namelessinstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,Bondsman, plain as plain could be.It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I hadconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare theeffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge uponthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that itwas most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer ofpretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. Itwas abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cutshort.Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadfulmystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with hisknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald headtattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sitand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with allthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me tostart up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence ofhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in thefirst agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done forme and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must sooncome back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, andbegin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leavehim there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as aprivate soldier.I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in thoselonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind andthe rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken andhanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and thedread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When hewas not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a raggedpack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, andin which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into thetable,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he wouldask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I complied,he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the firesurveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, betweenthe fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumbshow to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginarystudent pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, wasnot more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, andrecoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired meand the fonder he was of me.This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. Itlasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not goout, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, oneevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quiteworn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearfuldreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in aninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.“Quiet! It’s Herbert!” I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with theairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and againhow are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I musthave been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my—Halloa! Ibeg your pardon.”He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, byseeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowlyputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for somethingelse.“Herbert, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors, whileHerbert stood staring and wondering, “something very strange hashappened. This is—a visitor of mine.”“It’s all right, dear boy!” said Provis coming forward, with his littleclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. “Take it inyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split inany way sumever! Kiss it!”“Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at mewith a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provisimmediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your oath, youknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan’t make a gentleman onyou!”Chapter XLI.In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet ofHerbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and Irecounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelingsreflected in Herbert’s face, and not least among them, my repugnancetowards the man who had done so much for me.What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if therehad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.Saving his troublesome sense of having been “low” on one occasion sincehis return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, themoment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of thepossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boastthat he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me supportthe character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much asfor himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quiteestablished in his own mind.“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after havingdiscoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I comeback—for half a minute—I’ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I hadbeen low. But don’t you fret yourself on that score. I ain’t made Pip agentleman, and Pip ain’t a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur menot to know what’s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, you twomay count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on. Muzzled I havebeen since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzledI am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.”Herbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specificconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We wereanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave ustogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and satlate. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and sawhim safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, Iexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night ofhis arrival.Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, Ihad always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and inbringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in alarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind isconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself thatany of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few whowere passing passed on their several ways, and the street was emptywhen I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gatewith us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by thefountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where Ilived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still andlifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before soblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some soundwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider thequestion, What was to be done?The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it hadstood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, inone unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances withhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say hischair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, butnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He hadno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for mypatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged thatconfidence without shaping a syllable.“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,—“what isto be done?”“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too stunnedto think.”“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must bedone. He is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages,and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.”“You mean that you can’t accept—”“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused. “Think of him! Look athim!”An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached tome, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!”“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking anotherpenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavilyin debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I havebeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated. “Don’t say fit for nothing.”“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and thatis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, butfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing awarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do. Ifyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose youwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you havealready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!Besides, it’s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’shouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, youknow.”Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.“But there is another question,” said Herbert. “This is an ignorant,determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, heseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fiercecharacter.”“I know he is,” I returned. “Let me tell you what evidence I have seenof it.” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, ofthat encounter with the other convict.“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this! He comes here at the perilof his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment ofrealisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground fromunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal nightof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as hisputting himself in the way of being taken.”“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be greatdanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as heremains in England, and that would be his reckless course if youforsook him.”I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon mefrom the first, and the working out of which would make me regardmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in mychair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, thateven if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I shouldbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was sowretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I wouldfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than Iwould ever have come to this!But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get himout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may beinduced to go.”“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the nextstreet, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind tohim and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to gethim away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anythingelse in his life, now.”“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open handsheld out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. “I knownothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a nightand see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrifiedme two days in my childhood!”Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to andfro together, studying the carpet.“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can takeno further benefits from him; do you?”“Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”“Herbert, can you ask me?”“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life hehas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, fromthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stira finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, inHeaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,with only that done.“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge ofhis history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him pointblank.”“Yes. Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in themorning.” For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he wouldcome to breakfast with us.With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreamsconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fearwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returnedtransport. Waking, I never lost that fear.He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and satdown to his meal. He was full of plans “for his gentleman’s coming outstrong, and like a gentleman,” and urged me to begin speedily upon thepocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered thechambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me tolook out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which hecould have “a shake-down.” When he had made an end of his breakfast,and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word ofpreface,—“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle thatthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. Youremember?”“Remember!” said he. “I think so!”“We want to know something about that man—and about you. It is strangeto know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able totell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowingmore?”“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you know,Pip’s comrade?”“Assuredly,” replied Herbert.“As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted. “The oath applies toall.”“I understand it to do so.”“And look’ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,” heinsisted again.“So be it.”He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to thinkit might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on eachknee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silentmoments, looked round at us and said what follows.Chapter XLII.“Dear boy and Pip’s comrade. I am not a-going fur to tell you my lifelike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I’llput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, injail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you’ve got it.That’s _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,arter Pip stood my friend.“I’ve been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged. I’ve beenlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I’ve been carted here andcarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, andstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I’ve no morenotion where I was born than you have—if so much. I first become awareof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun hadrun away from me—a man—a tinker—and he’d took the fire with him, andleft me wery cold.“I know’d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen’d Abel. How did I know it?Much as I know’d the birds’ names in the hedges to be chaffinch,sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only asthe birds’ names come out true, I supposed mine did.“So fur as I could find, there warn’t a soul that see young AbelMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright athim, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,took up, to that extent that I reg’larly grow’d up took up.“This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur asmuch to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, forthere warn’t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got thename of being hardened. ‘This is a terrible hardened one,’ they says toprison wisitors, picking out me. ‘May be said to live in jails, thisboy.’ Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measuredmy head, some on ’em,—they had better a measured my stomach,—and otherson ’em giv me tracts what I couldn’t read, and made me speeches what Icouldn’t understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. Butwhat the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,mustn’t I?—Howsomever, I’m a getting low, and I know what’s due. Dearboy and Pip’s comrade, don’t you be afeerd of me being low.“Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,—thoughthat warn’t as often as you may think, till you put the questionwhether you would ha’ been over-ready to give me work yourselves,—a bitof a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of ahaymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don’t pay andlead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in aTraveller’s Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at apenny a time learnt me to write. I warn’t locked up as often now asformerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.“At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquaintedwi’ a man whose skull I’d crack wi’ this poker, like the claw of alobster, if I’d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; andthat’s the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone lastnight.“He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he’d been to a publicboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and wasa dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was thenight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booththat I know’d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables whenI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was asporting one) called him out, and said, ‘I think this is a man thatmight suit you,’—meaning I was.“Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has awatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit ofclothes.“‘To judge from appearances, you’re out of luck,’ says Compeyson to me.“‘Yes, master, and I’ve never been in it much.’ (I had come out ofKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might havebeen for something else; but it warn’t.)“‘Luck changes,’ says Compeyson; ‘perhaps yours is going to change.’“I says, ‘I hope it may be so. There’s room.’“‘What can you do?’ says Compeyson.“‘Eat and drink,’ I says; ‘if you’ll find the materials.’“Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me fiveshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.“I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me onto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson’s business in whichwe was to go pardners? Compeyson’s business was the swindling,handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sortsof traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legsout of and get the profits from and let another man in for, wasCompeyson’s business. He’d no more heart than a iron file, he was ascold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,—not asbeing so chrisen’d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was ashadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with arich lady some years afore, and they’d made a pot of money by it; butCompeyson betted and gamed, and he’d have run through the king’s taxes.So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,and Compeyson’s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pityon him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing andnobody.“I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn’t; and I won’t pretend Iwas partick’ler—for where ’ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?So I begun wi’ Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthurlived at the top of Compeyson’s house (over nigh Brentford it was), andCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, incase he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settledthe account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come atearing down into Compeyson’s parlour late at night, in only a flannelgown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson’s wife,‘Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can’t get rid ofher. She’s all in white,’ he says, ‘wi’ white flowers in her hair, andshe’s awful mad, and she’s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and shesays she’ll put it on me at five in the morning.’“Says Compeyson: ‘Why, you fool, don’t you know she’s got a livingbody? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,or in at the window, and up the stairs?’“‘I don’t know how she’s there,’ says Arthur, shivering dreadful withthe horrors, ‘but she’s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,awful mad. And over where her heart’s broke—_you_ broke it!—there’sdrops of blood.’“Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. ‘Go up alonger thisdrivelling sick man,’ he says to his wife, ‘and Magwitch, lend her ahand, will you?’ But he never come nigh himself.“Compeyson’s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved mostdreadful. ‘Why look at her!’ he cries out. ‘She’s a shaking the shroudat me! Don’t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain’t it awful to see herso mad?’ Next he cries, ‘She’ll put it on me, and then I’m done for!Take it away from her, take it away!’ And then he catched hold of us,and kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believedI see her myself.“Compeyson’s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get thehorrors off, and by and by he quieted. ‘O, she’s gone! Has her keeperbeen for her?’ he says. ‘Yes,’ says Compeyson’s wife. ‘Did you tell himto lock her and bar her in?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And to take that ugly thing awayfrom her?’ ‘Yes, yes, all right.’ ‘You’re a good creetur,’ he says,‘don’t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!’“He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, andthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, ‘Here she is! She’sgot the shroud again. She’s unfolding it. She’s coming out of thecorner. She’s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you—one of eachside—don’t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.Don’t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don’t let her lift me up toget it round me. She’s lifting me up. Keep me down!’ Then he liftedhimself up hard, and was dead.“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and mewas soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my ownbook,—this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comradeon.“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which ’udtake a week—I’ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, thatthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was alwaysin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always agetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he’d got craft, andhe’d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and nomercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi’—Stop though! I ain’tbrought _her_ in—”He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place inthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, andspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put themon again.“There ain’t no need to go into it,” he said, looking round once more.“The time wi’ Compeyson was a’most as hard a time as ever I had; thatsaid, all’s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, formisdemeanor, while with Compeyson?”I answered, No.“Well!” he said, “I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up onsuspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year thatit lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was bothcommitted for felony,—on a charge of putting stolen notes incirculation,—and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,‘Separate defences, no communication,’ and that was all. And I was somiserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung onmy back, afore I could get Jaggers.“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentlemanCompeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black clothes and hiswhite pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When theevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that hadcome for’ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that themoney had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to workthe thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I seethe plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, ‘My lord andgentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as youreyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will bespoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke toas such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these heretransactions, and only suspected; t’other, the elder, always seen in’em and always wi’ his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there isbut one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which ismuch the worst one?’ And such-like. And when it come to character,warn’t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn’t it hisschoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn’t it him ashad been know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt tohis disadvantage? And warn’t it me as had been tried afore, and as hadbeen know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And whenit come to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi’his face dropping every now and then into his whitepocket-handkercher,—ah! and wi’ verses in his speech, too,—and warn’tit me as could only say, ‘Gentlemen, this man at my side is a mostprecious rascal’? And when the verdict come, warn’t it Compeyson as wasrecommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, andgiving up all the information he could agen me, and warn’t it me as gotnever a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, ‘Once out ofthis court, I’ll smash that face of yourn!’ ain’t it Compeyson as praysthe Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? Andwhen we’re sentenced, ain’t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,and ain’t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done sowell, and ain’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender ofwiolent passion, likely to come to worse?”He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checkedit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretchingout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I ain’t a-goingto be low, dear boy!”He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wipedhis face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.[Illustration]“I had said to Compeyson that I’d smash that face of his, and I sworeLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but Icouldn’t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind himand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one athim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn’t astrong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. Iescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,envying them as was in ’em and all over, when I first see my boy!”He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrentto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.“By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on themmarshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, toget quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted himdown. I smashed his face. ‘And now,’ says I ‘as the worst thing I cando, caring nothing for myself, I’ll drag you back.’ And I’d have swumoff, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I’d a got himaboard without the soldiers.“Of course he’d much the best of it to the last,—his character was sogood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderousintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, broughtto trial again, and sent for life. I didn’t stop for life, dear boy andPip’s comrade, being here.”He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took histangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from hisbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.“Is he dead?” I asked, after a silence.“Is who dead, dear boy?”“Compeyson.”“He hopes _I_ am, if he’s alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look.“I never heerd no more of him.”Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. Hesoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with hiseyes on the fire, and I read in it:—“Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professedto be Miss Havisham’s lover.”I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by;but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as hestood smoking by the fire.Chapter XLIII.Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might betraced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the stateof mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prisonbefore meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in whichI now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,and the returned transport whom I harboured? The road would be none thesmoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would notbe helped, nor I extenuated.A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was alreadythere. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I couldhardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear ofhim, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that anysuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to releasehimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming aninformer was scarcely to be imagined.Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe—or so I resolved—a wordof Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could goabroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when wewere left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley’s, Estella’s maid was calledto tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House,as usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone therewithout me; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservationin the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, thather maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. Icould make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should makenothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (Ialways took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to theconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I cameback from Miss Havisham’s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were toconsider separately what it would be best to say; whether we shoulddevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspiciousobservation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, shouldpropose an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything,and he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in hispresent hazard was not to be thought of.Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promiseto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joeor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, andHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to beabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of hisimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to bebegun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbertalso, that he might be best got away across the water, on thatpretence,—as, to make purchases, or the like.Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham’s, I setoff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out onthe open country road when the day came creeping on, halting andwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags ofmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzlyride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was avery lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went intothe coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where Iordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I verywell knew why he had come there.Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which hadnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter ofcoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with whichit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highlyirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. Bydegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before thefire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put myhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace tostir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.“Is this a cut?” said Mr. Drummle.“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it’s you, is it? How do you do? I waswondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myselfside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to thefire.“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little awaywith his shoulder.“Yes,” said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.“Beastly place,” said Drummle. “Your part of the country, I think?”“Yes,” I assented. “I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.”“Not in the least like it,” said Drummle.Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an inch ofthe fire.“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,but equally determined.“Do you stay here long?”“Can’t say,” answered Mr. Drummle. “Do you?”“Can’t say,” said I.I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle’sshoulder had claimed another hair’s breadth of room, I should havejerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urgeda similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.He whistled a little. So did I.“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle.“Yes. What of that?” said I.Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, “Oh!”and laughed.“Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?”“No,” said he, “not particularly. I am going out for a ride in thesaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-wayvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses—andsmithies—and that. Waiter!”“Yes, sir.”“Is that horse of mine ready?”“Brought round to the door, sir.”“I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won’t ride to-day; the weatherwon’t do.”“Very good, sir.”“And I don’t dine, because I’m going to dine at the lady’s.”“Very good, sir.”Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on hisgreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and soexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as therobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seathim on the fire.One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until reliefcame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, wellsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with ourhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside inthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle’swas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we bothstood our ground.“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I wasthere.”“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.“Come, come! They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle. “Youshouldn’t have lost your temper.”“Mr. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on thatsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on thatoccasion), I don’t throw glasses.”“I do,” said Drummle.After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state ofsmouldering ferocity, I said,—“Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think it anagreeable one.”“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “Idon’t think anything about it.”“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that wehold no kind of communication in future.”“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggestedmyself, or done—more likely—without suggesting. But don’t lose yourtemper. Haven’t you lost enough without that?”“What do you mean, sir?”“Waiter!” said Drummle, by way of answering me.The waiter reappeared.“Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don’tride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”“Quite so, sir!”When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of hishand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocketand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking andboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, withoutintroducing Estella’s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there wereno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might haveremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but forthe incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waiter, Ithink—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats andrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, wewere obliged to give way.I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting inhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thoughthe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar inhis mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dressappeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where:whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummleleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with ajerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouchingshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards mereminded me of Orlick.Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he orno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and thejourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old housethat it would have been so much the better for me never to haveentered, never to have seen.Chapter XLIV.In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candlesburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havishamseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They bothraised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. Iderived that, from the look they interchanged.“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, andthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, asplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceivedI had discovered my real benefactor.“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak toEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.”Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen heroccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a naturalplace for me, that day.“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,presently—in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will notdisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in theaction of Estella’s fingers as they worked that she attended to what Isaid; but she did not look up.“I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is notmy secret, but another’s.”As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how togo on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another’s.Well?”“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when Ibelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, Isuppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might havecome,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paidfor it?”“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.”“And that Mr. Jaggers—”“Mr. Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “hadnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, andhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the samerelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be thatas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was nosuppression or evasion so far.“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at leastyou led me on?” said I.“Yes,” she returned, again nodding steadily, “I let you go on.”“Was that kind?”“Who am I,” cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor andflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her insurprise,—“who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind?”It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. Itold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.“Well, well, well!” she said. “What else?”“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to sootheher, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only formy own information. What follows has another (and I hope moredisinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, youpunished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expressesyour intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”“I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been myhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or younot to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.”Waiting until she was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of her ina wild and sudden way,—I went on.“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know themto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should befalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to youor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, thatyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if yousuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, andincapable of anything designing or mean.”“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham.“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me tohave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, andMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.”This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to dothem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, andthen said quietly,—“What do you want for them?”“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others. Theymay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the samenature.”Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,—“What do you want for them?”“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that Ireddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the moneyto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from thenature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show youhow.”“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling herhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two yearsago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed. Why I failin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of thesecret which is another person’s and not mine.”She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light ofthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by thecollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—atfirst, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention. Allthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed herattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse inour dialogue,—“What else?”“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command mytrembling voice, “you know I love you. You know that I have loved youlong and dearly.”She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and herfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmovedcountenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and fromher to me.“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced meto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thoughtyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.But I must say it now.”Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,Estella shook her head.“I know,” said I, in answer to that action,—“I know. I have no hopethat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may becomeof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I loveyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shookher head again.“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practiseon the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through allthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflectedon the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.”I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as shesat looking by turns at Estella and at me.“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments,fancies,—I don’t know how to call them,—which I am not able tocomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a formof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touchnothing there. I don’t care for what you say at all. I have tried towarn you of this; now, have I not?”I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”“Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.Now, did you not think so?”“I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, andbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.”“It is in _my_ nature,” she returned. And then she added, with a stressupon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me. I make a greatdifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I cando no more.”“Is it not true,” said I, “that Bentley Drummle is in town here, andpursuing you?”“It is quite true,” she replied, referring to him with the indifferenceof utter contempt.“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines withyou this very day?”She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,“Quite true.”“You cannot love him, Estella!”Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,“What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I donot mean what I say?”“You would never marry him, Estella?”She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with herwork in her hands. Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth? I amgoing to be married to him.”I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself betterthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hearher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such aghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me, even in mypassionate hurry and grief.“Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into thisfatal step. Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—butbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havishamgives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be doneto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who trulylove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even asdearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I canbear it better, for your sake!”My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would havebeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at allintelligible to her own mind.“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married tohim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall bemarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother byadoption? It is my own act.”“Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”“On whom should I fling myself away?” she retorted, with a smile.“Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (ifpeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It isdone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading meinto what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had mewait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, whichhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Sayno more. We shall never understand each other.”“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged, in despair.“Don’t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,” said Estella; “I shallnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionaryboy—or man?”“O Estella!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, dowhat I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and couldhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle’s wife?”“Nonsense,” she returned,—“nonsense. This will pass in no time.”“Never, Estella!”“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”“Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. Youhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, therough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have beenin every prospect I have ever seen since,—on the river, on the sails ofthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in thedarkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. Youhave been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has everbecome acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest Londonbuildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to bedisplaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been tome, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of mylife, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of thelittle good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, Iassociate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you tothat always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let mefeel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!”In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,I don’t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from aninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingeringmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soonafterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merelywith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her handstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare ofpity and remorse.All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out atthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when Iwent in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, andthen struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that timecome to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to theinn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coachand be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself astire myself out.It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrowintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near theMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple wasclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected tillto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, couldget to bed myself without disturbing him.As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after theTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take itill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he heldthe gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory Imentioned my name.“I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here’s a note, sir. Themessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by mylantern?”[Illustration]Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed toPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were thewords, “PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.” I opened it, the watchman holding uphis light, and read inside, in Wemmick’s writing,—“DON’T GO HOME.”Chapter XLV.Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I madethe best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackneychariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bedwas always to be got there at any hour of the night, and thechamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle nextin order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next inorder on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at theback, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddlingover the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into thefireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretchedlittle washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of thosevirtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, whichinstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could everbe lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at thebottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made astaringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, andlay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no moreclose my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at oneanother.What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was aninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as Ilooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what anumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from themarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lyingby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them evertumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—adisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionableapproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, thoseextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselvesaudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the littlewashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in thechest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquireda new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I sawwritten, DON’T GO HOME.Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they neverwarded off this DON’T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever Ithought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I hadread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummumsin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and hadbeen found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head thathe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed toassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the doorto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionshipof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. Butall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, werequestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposedthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when Ithought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when Irecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks andtones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I waspursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don’t go home.When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became avast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, presenttense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, donot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I maynot and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, andshould not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, androlled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon thewall again.I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it wasplain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equallyplain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only couldbe taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night hadbeen so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door tostartle me from my uneasy bed.The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock. The littleservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, Ipassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he wasmaking tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded aperspective view of the Aged in bed.“Halloa, Mr. Pip!” said Wemmick. “You did come home, then?”“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn’t go home.”“That’s all right,” said he, rubbing his hands. “I left a note for youat each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you cometo?”I told him.“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy thenotes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentaryevidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it may be putin. I’m going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toastingthis sausage for the Aged P.?”I said I should be delighted to do it.“Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,” said Wemmick to thelittle servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, don’t you see, Mr. Pip?”he added, winking, as she disappeared.I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourseproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged’s sausage and hebuttered the crumb of the Aged’s roll.“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand oneanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we havebeen engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Officialsentiments are one thing. We are extra official.”I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lightedthe Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in acertain place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it’s aswell not to mention names when avoidable—”“Much better not,” said I. “I understand you.”“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that acertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and notunpossessed of portable property,—I don’t know who it may really be,—wewon’t name this person—”“Not necessary,” said I.“—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a goodmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,and not quite irrespective of the government expense—”In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s sausage,and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick’s; for whichI apologised.“—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard ofthereabouts. From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raisedand theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in GardenCourt, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”“By whom?” said I.“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clashwith official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heardother curious things in the same place. I don’t tell it you oninformation received. I heard it.”He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and setforth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placingit before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth,and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up,and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Thenhe placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “Allright, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “Allright, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacitunderstanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and wastherefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being incomplete ignorance of these proceedings.“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason tosuspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is inseparable fromthe person to whom you have adverted; is it?”Wemmick looked very serious. “I couldn’t undertake to say that, of myown knowledge. I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at first. Butit either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from sayingas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far outof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But Itold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like toask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as hedeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in hisbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (hisnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to meonce, to put my question.“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name isCompeyson?”He answered with one other nod.“Is he living?”One other nod.“Is he in London?”He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gaveme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which he emphasised andrepeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what Iheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went toClarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.“And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into anydetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom,Jack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediateneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the waywhile you were out of the way.”“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”“He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him myopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard toofar out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something. Underexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when youare once in it. Don’t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till thingsslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert haddone?“Mr. Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half anhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he iscourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedriddenPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in abow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. Youare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”“Not personally,” said I.The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companionwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed topresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such verymoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide thestate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little timebefore I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert’sprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerfulphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally notbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem,and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchangedmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, Idid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by theriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, andbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnishedupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of thatas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought verywell of it, for three reasons I’ll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.It’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usualheap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near ityourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,through Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might beprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board aforeign packet-boat, there he is—ready.”Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again andagain, and begged him to proceed.“Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,and by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, orRichard,—whichever it may be,—you and I don’t want to know,—quitesuccessfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he wassummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road andcornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, thatit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himselfabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles offand quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back lastnight, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and youwant confusion.”Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, andbegan to get his coat on.“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “Ihave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from aWalworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personalcapacity,—I shall be glad to do it. Here’s the address. There can be noharm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all iswell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,—which is anotherreason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gonehome, don’t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip”;his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and letme finally impress one important point upon you.” He laid his handsupon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself ofthis evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don’t know whatmay happen to him. Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.”Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, Iforbore to try.“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off. If you had nothing morepressing to do than to keep here till dark, that’s what I shouldadvise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have aperfectly quiet day with the Aged,—he’ll be up presently,—and a littlebit of—you remember the pig?”“Of course,” said I.“Well; and a little bit of _him_. That sausage you toasted was his, andhe was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for oldacquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.I soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyedone another’s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and Inodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do itdrowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the firefor toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as fromhis glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins wasexpected.Chapter XLVI.Eight o’clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shoreboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-sideregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground tome; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wantedwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy tofind. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks’s Basin; and I had no otherguide to Chinks’s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myselfamong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards ofship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting intothe ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country ofaccumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the OldGreen Copper. After several times falling short of my destination andas often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon MillPond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered,where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and therewere two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruinedwindmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,—whose long andnarrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of woodenframes set in the ground, that looked like superannuatedhaymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with awooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which isanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,Mrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderlywoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She wasimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into theparlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his veryfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar roomand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at thecorner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon thechimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representingthe death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King Georgethe Third in a state coachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,on the terrace at Windsor.“All is well, Handel,” said Herbert, “and he is quite satisfied, thougheager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you’ll waittill she comes down, I’ll make you known to her, and then we’ll goupstairs. _That’s_ her father.”I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probablyexpressed the fact in my countenance.“I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,” said Herbert, smiling, “but Ihave never seen him. Don’t you smell rum? He is always at it.”“At rum?” said I.“Yes,” returned Herbert, “and you may suppose how mild it makes hisgout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in hisroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and_will_ weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler’s shop.”While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, andthen died away.“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation, “ifhe _will_ cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand—andeverywhere else—can’t expect to get through a Double Gloucester withouthurting himself.”He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furiousroar.“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.Whimple,” said Herbert, “for of course people in general won’t standthat noise. A curious place, Handel; isn’t it?”It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.“Mrs. Whimple,” said Herbert, when I told him so, “is the best ofhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without hermotherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and norelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.”“Surely that’s not his name, Herbert?”“No, no,” said Herbert, “that’s my name for him. His name is Mr.Barley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and motherto love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herselfor anybody else about her family!”Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that hefirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education atan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home tonurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to themotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated withequal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood thatnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, byreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subjectmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser’s stores.As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley’s sustainedgrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room dooropened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so camein with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of thebasket, and presented, blushing, as “Clara.” She really was a mostcharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom thattruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionateand tender smile, after we had talked a little; “here’s poor Clara’ssupper, served out every night. Here’s her allowance of bread, andhere’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum,—which I drink. This isMr. Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Twomutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, twoounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It’sstewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the gout,I should think!”There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way oflooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; andsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner ofyielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm; and something so gentle inher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin,and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in thebeam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her andHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly thegrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise washeard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore itthrough the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert,“Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away.“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert. “What doyou suppose he wants now, Handel?”“I don’t know,” said I. “Something to drink?”“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinarymerit. “He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.Wait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There hegoes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. “Now,” saidHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s drinking. Now,” saidHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “he’s down againon his back!”Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs tosee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard hoarselymuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, thefollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for somethingquite the reverse:—“Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley. Here’s old Bill Barley,bless your eyes. Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by theLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,here’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.”In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barleywould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, whileit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope whichwas fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh andairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I foundProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feelnone that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he wassoftened,—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could neverafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection hadresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respectingCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man mightotherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his owndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by hisfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgmentand sources of information?“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell youwhat caution he gave me and what advice.”This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I toldhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers orprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and thatmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keepingclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick hadsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the timecame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as mightbe safest in Wemmick’s judgment. What was to follow that I did nottouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about itin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and indeclared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living byenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettledand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if itwere no worse?He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. Hiscoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be aventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he hadvery little fear of his safety with such good help.Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said thatsomething had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’ssuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both goodwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when theright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and noboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chanceis worth saving. Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be agood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall intothat habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first orfifty-first.”I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed thatit should be carried into execution, and that Provis should neverrecognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that partof his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all wasright.Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, andthat I would take half an hour’s start of him. “I don’t like to leaveyou here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being saferhere than near me. Good-bye!”“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we maymeet again, and I don’t like good-bye. Say good-night!”“Good-night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the timecomes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good-night, good-night!”We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we lefthim on the landing outside his door, holding a light over thestair-rail to light us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought ofthe first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, andwhen I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious atparting from him as it was now.Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with noappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to thefoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the nameof Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.Campbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell therewas, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt astrong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living asecluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple andClara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.Campbell, but kept it to myself.When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and ofthe motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with alittle affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walkhad grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as thehills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there wereredeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin to fill itto overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, andwent home very sadly.All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. Thewindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were darkand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past thefountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were betweenme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedsidewhen he came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited andfatigued,—made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was assolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boatwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach herwithin a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training andpractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out incold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had beenout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as thehours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was OldLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide therewas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. ButI knew well enough how to ‘shoot’ the bridge after seeing it done, andso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down toErith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I werepulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw theblind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there lessfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a singleword of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that therewas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of beingwatched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigningpersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was inhiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant tostand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towardsClara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, goingswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.Chapter XLVII.Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain,and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing atthe Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing himas I did.My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressedfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know thewant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieveit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. ButI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take moremoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts andplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whetherit was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited byhis generosity since his revelation of himself.As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estellawas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but aconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I hadconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of herto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe ofhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did youwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your ownlast year, last month, last week?It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above arange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new causefor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terrorfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I wouldwith dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should befleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, andmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned toinaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowedabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I couldnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old LondonBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to bebrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doingthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among thewater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetingsthat I have now to tell of.One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at thewharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,and had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but hadbecome foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way backamong the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, Ihad seen the signal in his window, All well.As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfortmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection andsolitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I wouldafterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achievedhis questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it isnowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware thatMr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on thecontrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominouslyheard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connectionwith a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seenhim as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a redbrick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on everyhalf-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of theknives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within theLord Mayor’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the timein dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast ofdinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty’s service,—a mostexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite sotight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked allthe little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous andbrave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he wasvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding inthe cloth, and on that property married a young person inbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population ofPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beachto rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill,fill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, ordo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openlystated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposedto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was soeffectually done (the Swab family having considerable politicalinfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and thenit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a whitehat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with agridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody downfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he hadoverheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard ofbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary ofgreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were allto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain downthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. Theboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes onthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as YourHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved intoa dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from thatcorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware ofme.The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, inthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoriccountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged inthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying greatcowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account ofthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice ofhis daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in aflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententiousEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in ahigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talkedat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of variouscolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, withgreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if hewere lost in amazement.There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.Wopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in hismind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I satthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a largewatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking ofit when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found himwaiting for me near the door.“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down thestreet together. “I saw that you saw me.”“Saw you, Mr. Pip!” he returned. “Yes, of course I saw you. But whoelse was there?”“Who else?”“It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lostlook again; “and yet I could swear to him.”Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.“Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,”said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can’t be positive;yet I think I should.”Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round mewhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.“Oh! He can’t be in sight,” said Mr. Wopsle. “He went out before I wentoff. I saw him go.”Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspectedthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into someadmission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, butsaid nothing.“I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I sawthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like aghost.”My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speakyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set onto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I wasperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.“I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it isso very strange! You’ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. Icould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”“Indeed?” said I.“No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain ChristmasDay, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery’s, and somesoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?”“I remember it very well.”“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and thatwe joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I tookthe lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?”“I remember it all very well.” Better than he thought,—except the lastclause.“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and thatthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had beenseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?”“I see it all before me.”“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,with the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular aboutthat,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was anouter ring of dark night all about us?”“Yes,” said I. “I remember all that.”“Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. Isaw him over your shoulder.”“Steady!” I thought. I asked him then, “Which of the two do you supposeyou saw?”“The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I’ll swear Isaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.”“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could put onof its being nothing more to me. “Very curious indeed!”I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversationthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson’shaving been behind me “like a ghost.” For if he had ever been out of mythoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it wasin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that Ishould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if Ihad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then hadfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of dangerthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? Hecould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began toidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. Howwas he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. Ibelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken noespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that aface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or Iextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriaterefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It wasbetween twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gateswere shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick whatI had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for hishint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often tothe Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before Iwent to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be verycautious. And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before,if that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks’sBasin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bankas I looked at anything else.Chapter XLVIII.The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurredabout a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharfbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and wasstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busyconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some oneovertaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it through myarm.“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.Where are you bound for?”“For the Temple, I think,” said I.“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers.“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him incross-examination, “I do _not_ know, for I have not made up my mind.”“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You don’t mind admittingthat, I suppose?”“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”“And are not engaged?”“I don’t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So Ichanged my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered,serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside andslanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing upbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcelyfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of theafternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower atthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed thebusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its risingand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they wereplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in acorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembranceof a host of hanged clients.We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not havethought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so muchas a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had noobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But itwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever heraised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as ifthere were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr.Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you broughtMr. Pip into the office. Here it is.” He handed it to his principalinstead of to me.“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sentup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of youraddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter ofbusiness you mentioned to her. You’ll go down?”“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly inthose terms.“When do you think of going down?”“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who wasputting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain ofmy time. At once, I think.”“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr.Jaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, Isettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glassof wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but notat me.“So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played hiscards. He has won the pool.”It was as much as I could do to assent.“Hah! He is a promising fellow—in his way—but he may not have it allhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has tobe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her—”“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do notseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?”“I didn’t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to andbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should bea question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance workto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in suchcircumstances, because it’s a toss-up between two results.”“May I ask what they are?”“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers, “eitherbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; buthe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.”“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing himselfto me.“So here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking adecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each ofus and for himself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled tothe lady’s satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ thegentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slowyou are to-day!”She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon thetable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,as she spoke, arrested my attention.“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers.“Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was ratherpainful to me.”The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stoodlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, orwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she didgo. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes andsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remainedbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at thosehands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and Icompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband anda stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of thehousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come overme when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through thedeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when Isaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coachwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me likelightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a suddenglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of associationhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by achance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knittingaction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that thiswoman was Estella’s mother.Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missedthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I saidthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round thewine again, and went on with his dinner.Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in theroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her handswere Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she hadreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor lesssure that my conviction was the truth.It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,quite as a matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salarywhen that came round,—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state ofperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-officefor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrongtwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were gropingamong Mr. Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the righttwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards downGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I waswalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin hadevaporated into the evening air.“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over! He’s a wonderful man, without hisliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dinewith him,—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know thatwhat is said between you and me goes no further.”I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs.Bentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke ofthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentionedMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a rollof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went toMr. Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”“Did I?” he replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” he added,suddenly, “I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”“And what do _you_ call her?”“The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”“That’s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.”“I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest inbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and megoes no further.”“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story,—that is, I don’t knowall of it. But what I do know I’ll tell you. We are in our private andpersonal capacities, of course.”“Of course.”“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey formurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and Ibelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when itwas up, as you may suppose.”“But she was acquitted.”“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full ofmeaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was adesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, andhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said tohave made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after dayfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trialwhere he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every oneknew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—awoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this womanin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point ofjealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, inpoint of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There hadbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratchedand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but thiswoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.Jaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick,touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength ofher hands then, though he sometimes does now.”I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinnerparty.“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t yousee?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of herapprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; inparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfullycontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only abruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of herhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot ofbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could nothave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambleswere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as thefact that the brambles in question were found on examination to havebeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and littlespots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he madewas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, thatshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of themurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three yearsold—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, andwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, andyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must acceptall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may havedestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may havescratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murderof her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ havescratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accountedfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not inventedthem?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether toomany for the jury, and they gave in.”“Has she been in his service ever since?”“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “she went into his serviceimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has sincebeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she wastamed from the beginning.”“Do you remember the sex of the child?”“Said to have been a girl.”“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter formy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.Chapter XLIX.Putting Miss Havisham’s note in my pocket, that it might serve as mycredentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case herwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, Iwent down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the HalfwayHouse, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; forI sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and toleave it in the same manner.The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quietechoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the oldmonks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strongwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedralchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurriedon avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swellof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and therooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare hightrees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place waschanged, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants wholived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened thegate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham wasnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting onthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in thecontemplation of, the ashy fire.Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the oldchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. Therewas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me topity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I couldcharge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, inthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wreckedfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said ina low voice, “Is it real?”“It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lostno time.”“Thank you. Thank you.”As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, Iremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me whenyou were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. Butperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in myheart?”When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulousright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled itagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to dosomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is itnot?”“Something that I would like done very much.”“What is it?”I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I hadnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinkingin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to beso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showedthat she was conscious of the fact.“Do you break off,” she asked then, with her former air of being afraidof me, “because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?”“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stoppedbecause I thought you were not following what I said.”“Perhaps I was not,” she answered, putting a hand to her head. “Beginagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.”She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes washabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression offorcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told herhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how inthis I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for theywere the weighty secrets of another.“So!” said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. “Andhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?”I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. “Ninehundred pounds.”“If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret asyou have kept your own?”“Quite as faithfully.”“And your mind will be more at rest?”“Much more at rest.”“Are you very unhappy now?”She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in anunwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for myvoice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, andsoftly laid her forehead on it.“I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes ofdisquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.”After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fireagain.“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes ofunhappiness. Is it true?”“Too true.”“Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that asdone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?”“Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for thetone of the question. But there is nothing.”She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted roomfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from herpocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, andwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hungfrom her neck.“You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?”“Quite. I dined with him yesterday.”“This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at yourirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but ifyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send itto you.”“Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receivingit from him.”She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, andevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by thereceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembledagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which thepencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did withoutlooking at me.“My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, “Iforgive her,” though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray doit!”“O Miss Havisham,” said I, “I can do it now. There have been soremistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I wantforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.”She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her kneesat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often havebeen raised to heaven from her mother’s side.To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feetgave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and gotmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand ofmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it andwept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope thatthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She wasnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.“O!” she cried, despairingly. “What have I done! What have I done!”“If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let meanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.Is she married?”“Yes.”It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate househad told me so.“What have I done! What have I done!” She wrung her hands, and crushedher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. “Whathave I done!”I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done agrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the formthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride foundvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light ofday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she hadsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do andmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knewequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing herpunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for thisearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had becomea master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,the vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have beencurses in this world?“Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you alooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not knowwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!” And so again,twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!“Miss Havisham,” I said, when her cry had died away, “you may dismissme from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, andif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping apart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do thatthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.”“Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip—my dear!” There was an earnest womanlycompassion for me in her new affection. “My dear! Believe this: whenshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. Atfirst, I meant no more.”“Well, well!” said I. “I hope so.”“But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually didworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back andpoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.”“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart,even to be bruised or broken.”With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, andthen burst out again, What had she done!“If you knew all my story,” she pleaded, “you would have somecompassion for me and a better understanding of me.”“Miss Havisham,” I answered, as delicately as I could, “I believe I maysay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I firstleft this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,and I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passedbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative toEstella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?”She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, andher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, andreplied, “Go on.”“Whose child was Estella?”She shook her head.“You don’t know?”She shook her head again.“But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?”“Brought her here.”“Will you tell me how that came about?”She answered in a low whisper and with caution: “I had been shut up inthese rooms a long time (I don’t know how long; you know what time theclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rearand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent forhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in thenewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he wouldlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her hereasleep, and I called her Estella.”“Might I ask her age then?”“Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left anorphan and I adopted her.”So convinced I was of that woman’s being her mother, that I wanted noevidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, Ithought, the connection here was clear and straight.What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I hadsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knewof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. Nomatter with what other words we parted; we parted.Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. Icalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that Iwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place beforeleaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on whichthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, andleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood onend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round bythe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by thepaths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so drearyall!Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a littledoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out atthe opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had startedand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold wasencumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back.A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment ofthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging tothe beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beamshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to besure I was there in an instant.The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of thisillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel anindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where Ihad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing oninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to letme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to goupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as Ihad left her. I took the latter course and went up.I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated inthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her backtowards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietlyaway, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I sawher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all abouther, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them overher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the samepurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on theground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I coveredher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,—that thisoccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, orthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on thefloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight werefloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her fadedbridal dress.Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders runningaway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless criesat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, likea prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, orwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that theflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been hergarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or eventouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if Iunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the firewould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon’scoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both myhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense offeeling.On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger laymainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon’s directions, her bed wascarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened tobe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,an hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike herstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she stillhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they hadcovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with awhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something thathad been and was changed was still upon her.I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and Igot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the nextpost. Miss Havisham’s family I took upon myself; intending tocommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as heliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,as soon as I returned to town.There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what hadhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight shebegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in thatshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, “What have I done!”And then, “When she first came, I meant to save her from misery likemine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgiveher!’” She never changed the order of these three sentences, but shesometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting inanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, thatpressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings couldnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that Iwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, andbeing taken up clear of the town. At about six o’clock of the morning,therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just asthey said, not stopping for being touched, “Take the pencil and writeunder my name, ‘I forgive her.’”Chapter L.My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again inthe morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, lessseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flameshad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. Myright hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. Itwas bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left handand arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat likea cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair hadbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he cameback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. Hewas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and putthem on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply gratefulfor.At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, Imight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of theflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozedfor a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by herrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain ofthe mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain Isuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attentionengaged.Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That wasmade apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by ouragreeing—without agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands aquestion of so many hours, not of so many weeks.My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether allwas well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfectconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until theday was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, moreby the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to itspontaneously.“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”“Where was Clara?”“Dear little thing!” said Herbert. “She was up and down withGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floorthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.What with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think hispegging must be nearly over.”“And then you will be married, Herbert?”“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out uponthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I’ll sit down here, and get thebandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I wasspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?”“I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.”“So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, andtold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about somewoman that he had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?”I had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.”“Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.Shall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?”“Tell me by all means. Every word.”Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had beenrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.“Your head is cool?” he said, touching it.“Quite,” said I. “Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”“It seems,” said Herbert, “—there’s a bandage off most charmingly, andnow comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,don’t it? but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the womanwas a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”“To what last degree?”“Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”“I don’t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?”“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” saidHerbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, andthe reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis. Itwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had beena struggle—in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for thevictim was found throttled.”“Was the woman brought in guilty?”“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?”“This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a littlechild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the verynight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, theyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and sworethat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and heshould never see it again; then she vanished.—There’s the worst armcomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the righthand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light thanby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don’t see the poorblistered patches too distinctly.—You don’t think your breathing isaffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.”“Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?”“There comes the darkest part of Provis’s life. She did.”“That is, he says she did.”“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. “He says it all.I have no other information.”“No, to be sure.”“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child’s mother ill,or whether he had used the child’s mother well, Provis doesn’t say; butshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life hedescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity forher, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should becalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the causeof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kepthimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and wasonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom thejealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lostthe child and the child’s mother.”“I want to ask—”“A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keepingout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of courseafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping himpoorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbedthe point of Provis’s animosity.”“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he toldyou when this happened?”“Particularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. Hisexpression was, ‘a round score o’ year ago, and a’most directly after Itook up wi’ Compeyson.’ How old were you when you came upon him in thelittle churchyard?”“I think in my seventh year.”“Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and youbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who wouldhave been about your age.”“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can yousee me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.“Look at me.”“I do look at you, my dear boy.”“Touch me.”“I do touch you, my dear boy.”“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is muchdisordered by the accident of last night?”“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.“You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”“I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down theriver, is Estella’s Father.”Chapter LI.What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and provingEstella’s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that thequestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put beforeme by a wiser head than my own.But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I wasseized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matterdown,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether Ifelt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad totransfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned somerays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhapsthe latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Streetthat night. Herbert’s representations that, if I did, I should probablybe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety woulddepend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have myhurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went outtogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I leftHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went overthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all thingsstraight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers intoMr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into theouter office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knewwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmicktogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing tocompromise him.My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over myshoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a briefaccount of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had togive him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion causedour talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by therules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described thedisaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in thepockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the officialproceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’tsmell fire at the present moment.My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then producedMiss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds forHerbert. Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his head whenI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that wasin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, lookedon at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket,when he had signed it, “that we do nothing for _you_.”“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether shecould do nothing for me, and I told her No.”“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers. And I sawWemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”“I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;“but every man ought to know his own business best.”“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,“is portable property.”As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had atheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her togive me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gaveme all she possessed.”“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots andthen straightening himself. “Hah! I don’t think I should have done so,if I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own businessbest.”“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child than MissHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.”Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”“I have seen her mother within these three days.”“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.“And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.”“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said I. “Iknow her father too.”A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was tooself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its beingbrought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did notknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis’saccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’sclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reasonfor claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of thisunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’s part before, though I was quite sureof it now.“So! You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers.“Yes,” I replied, “and his name is Provis—from New South Wales.”Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slighteststart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and thesooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of theaction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received theannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him justthen, lest Mr. Jaggers’s sharpness should detect that there had beensome communication unknown to him between us.“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as hepaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis makethis claim?”“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has noknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was sounexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocketwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and lookedwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservationthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in factknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I looktowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had beenfor some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s look. When I did at lastturn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I found that he had unposted hispen, and was intent upon the table before him.“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on thetable. “What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?”But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made apassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank andmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I hadlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I hadmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. Irepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidencefrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I saidthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wantedassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as hecared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anythingelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still andsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned toWemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentleheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all theinnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your businesslife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and torepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to bemore open with me!”I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgivingcrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from hisemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into somethinglike a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You with an old father, and youwith pleasant and playful ways?”“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ’em here, what does itmatter?”“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smilingopenly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. “Ithink you’re another.”Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently stilldistrustful that the other was taking him in.“_You_ with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it beso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if _you_ might beplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one ofthese days, when you’re tired of all this work.”Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, andactually drew a sigh. “Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poordreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much fresherexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I’ll put acase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.”He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expresslysaid that he admitted nothing.“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case. Put the case that awoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her childconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legaladviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye tothe latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Putthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for aneccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”“I follow you, sir.”“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all hesaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certaindestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried ata criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case thathe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growingup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he sawin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to beprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.”“I follow you, sir.”“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of theheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared makeno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had thispower: “I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked youthrough it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless itshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall beproduced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bringyou off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,your child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and thatthe woman was cleared.”“I understand you perfectly.”“But that I make no admissions?”“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a littleshaken the woman’s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to besheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down theold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breakingout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehendthe imaginary case?”“Quite.”“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. Thatthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That themother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so manymiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret wasstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last caseto yourself very carefully.”“I do.”“I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.”And Wemmick said, “I do.”“For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father’s? I thinkhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother’s? Ithink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. Forthe daughter’s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish herparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back todisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last forlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made herthe subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at one time or another,been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell youthat you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well ofit—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged righthand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ offtoo.”I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched hislips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “whatitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?”Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that theodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not tosay conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessionallight to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were nowinflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, andWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallestpoint in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such illterms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance ofMike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose onhis sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearancewithin those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person orin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldestdaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted thismelancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisteriallybefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike’s eyehappened to twinkle with a tear.“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.“What do you come snivelling here for?”“I didn’t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You’re not in a fit state tocome here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.What do you mean by it?”“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that again!”“Now look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, andpointing to the door. “Get out of this office. I’ll have no feelingshere. Get out.”“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers andWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, andwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they hadjust had lunch.Chapter LII.From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to MissSkiffins’s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins’s brother, theaccountant, going straight to Clarriker’s and bringing Clarriker to me,I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was theonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,since I was first apprised of my great expectations.Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the Housewere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish asmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extensionof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity wouldgo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for aseparation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been moresettled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were looseningits hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come homeof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he toldme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting ClaraBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to jointhem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up theNile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part inthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert’s way was clearing fast, andthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and hisdaughter would soon be happily provided for.We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though itpresented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to healthat I was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerablyrestored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I receivedthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.“Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or sayWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to tryit. Now burn.”When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire—but notbefore we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do. For, ofcourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.“I have thought it over again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think Iknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. Agood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic andhonourable.”I had thought of him more than once.“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”“It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a merefreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him knowthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.You go with him?”“No doubt.”“Where?”It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given thepoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,—Hamburg, Rotterdam,Antwerp,—the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Anyforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. Ihad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in theboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place forsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers wouldleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to getdown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spotuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where welay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if wemade inquiries beforehand.Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately afterbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer forHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed ourthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreignsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfiedourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separatedfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to dowithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported itdone. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seenStartop, and he was more than ready to join.Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not ourobject, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should notcome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; thathe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that heshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, onWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all thearrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and thathe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him onboard.These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letterin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though notill-written. It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I lefthome), and its contents were these:—“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrownight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,you had better come. If you want information regarding _your uncleProvis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time._You must come alone_. Bring this with you.”I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strangeletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that Imust decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which wouldtake me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think ofgoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. Andagain, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have someimportant bearing on the flight itself.If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should stillhave gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,—my watch showingme that the coach started within half an hour,—I resolved to go. Ishould certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my UncleProvis. That, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s busypreparation, turned the scale.It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents ofalmost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read thismysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to besecret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the samemechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, tellinghim that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, Ihad decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how MissHavisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lockup the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. IfI had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should havemissed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came outof the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep instraw, when I came to myself.For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; ithad so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morninghurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I hadwaited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And nowI began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubtwhether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to considerwhether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue againstever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass throughall those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I supposevery few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provisby name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned alreadywithout knowing it,—if that be reasoning,—in case any harm shouldbefall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and drearyto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outsidein my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn ofminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it waspreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; shewas still very ill, though considered something better.My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and Idined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not ableto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it forme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertainme with my own story,—of course with the popular feature thatPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.“Do you know the young man?” said I.“Know him!” repeated the landlord. “Ever since he was—no height atall.”“Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?”“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now andagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”“What man is that?”“Him that I speak of,” said the landlord. “Mr. Pumblechook.”“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but hecan’t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”“Does Pumblechook say so?”“Say so!” replied the landlord. “He han’t no call to say so.”“But does he say so?”“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell ofit, sir,” said the landlord.I thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it. Long-sufferingand loving Joe, _you_ never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”“Your appetite’s been touched like by your accident,” said thelandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. “Try a tendererbit.”“No, thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over thefire. “I can eat no more. Please take it away.”I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, asthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;the meaner he, the nobler Joe.My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over thefire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but notfrom my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastenedround my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets forthe letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw ofthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was thelittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.[Illustration]Chapter LIII.It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosedlands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line therewas a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red largemoon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, inamong the piled mountains of cloud.There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. Astranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they wereso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knewthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and hadno excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against myinclination, I went on against it.The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, northat in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towardsthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the oldlights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knewthe limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were milesapart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the twobright specks.At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to standstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway aroseand blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little whileI seemed to have the whole flats to myself.It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime wasburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up andleft, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. Itlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by thetools and barrows that were lying about.Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rudepath lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickenedmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof againstthe weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud andooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kilncrept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and Iknocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw alighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a trucklebedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?”but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that itwas past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being stillno answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seenalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within theshelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I wasconsidering that some one must have been there lately and must soon becoming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my headto look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had takenup the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violentshock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught ina strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I’ve got you!”“What is this?” I cried, struggling. “Who is it? Help, help, help!”Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on mybad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man’s hand,sometimes a strong man’s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden mycries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggledineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. “Andnow,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out again, andI’ll make short work of you!”Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by thesurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put inexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burntbefore, it were now being boiled.The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of blackdarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel hewanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon thesparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed andbreathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the bluepoint of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,—nowonder there,—and one after another the sparks died out.The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. Asthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, andtouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bendingover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, andshowed me Orlick.Whom I had looked for, I don’t know. I had not looked for him. Seeinghim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyesupon him.He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle awayfrom him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his armsfolded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened toa stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,—a fixturethere,—the means of ascent to the loft above.“Now,” said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, “I’vegot you.”“Unbind me. Let me go!”“Ah!” he returned, “_I_’ll let you go. I’ll let you go to the moon,I’ll let you go to the stars. All in good time.”“Why have you lured me here?”“Don’t you know?” said he, with a deadly look.“Why have you set upon me in the dark?”“Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better thantwo. O you enemy, you enemy!”His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his armsfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had amalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, heput his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with abrass-bound stock.“Do you know this?” said he, making as if he would take aim at me. “Doyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!”“Yes,” I answered.[Illustration]“You cost me that place. You did. Speak!”“What else could I do?”“You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you tocome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?”“When did I?”“When didn’t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name toher.”“You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have doneyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.”“You’re a liar. And you’ll take any pains, and spend any money, todrive me out of this country, will you?” said he, repeating my words toBiddy in the last interview I had with her. “Now, I’ll tell you a pieceof information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out ofthis country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twentytimes told, to the last brass farden!” As he shook his heavy hand atme, with his mouth snarling like a tiger’s, I felt that it was true.“What are you going to do to me?”“I’m a-going,” said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with aheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,—“I’ma-going to have your life!”He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew itacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.“You was always in Old Orlick’s way since ever you was a child. Yougoes out of his way this present night. He’ll have no more on you.You’re dead.”I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I lookedwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.“More than that,” said he, folding his arms on the table again, “Iwon’t have a rag of you, I won’t have a bone of you, left on earth.I’ll put your body in the kiln,—I’d carry two such to it, on myshoulders—and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shallnever know nothing.”My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequencesof such a death. Estella’s father would believe I had deserted him,would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I hadcalled at Miss Havisham’s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy wouldnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what Ihad suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passedthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terriblethan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And soquick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborngenerations,—Estella’s children, and their children,—while the wretch’swords were yet on his lips.“Now, wolf,” said he, “afore I kill you like any other beast,—which iswot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,—I’ll have a good lookat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!”It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though fewcould know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and thehopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported bya scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, Iresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making somelast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest ofmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, ofHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken nofarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear tome, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on mymiserable errors,—still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, Iwould have done it.He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around hisneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drinkslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, andtook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I sawflash into his face.“Wolf!” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a-going to tellyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.”Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhaustedthe whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and herdeath, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.“It was you, villain,” said I.“I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you,” heretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at thevacant air between us. “I come upon her from behind, as I come upon youto-night. _I_ giv’ it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been alimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn’t have cometo life again. But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You wasfavoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of thebottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctlyunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make anend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knewthat when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crepttowards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, hewould do as he had done in my sister’s case,—make all haste to thetown, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. Myrapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street withhim in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh andthe white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and yearswhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presentedpictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state ofmy brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of personswithout seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness ofthese images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon himhimself,—who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!—thatI knew of the slightest action of his fingers.When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which hesat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.“Wolf, I’ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbledover on your stairs that night.”I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows ofthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman’s lantern on the wall. Isaw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.“And why was Old Orlick there? I’ll tell you something more, wolf. Youand her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far asgetting a easy living in it goes, and I’ve took up with new companions,and new masters. Some of ’em writes my letters when I wants ’emwrote,—do you mind?—writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;they’re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I’ve had a firm mindand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at yoursister’s burying. I han’t seen a way to get you safe, and I’ve lookedarter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,‘Somehow or another I’ll have him!’ What! When I looks for you, I findsyour uncle Provis, eh?”Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks’s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use wasover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on hisback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast runningout to sea!“_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know’d you at Gargery’s when you was sosmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger andthumb and chucked you away dead (as I’d thoughts o’ doing, odd times,when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and youhadn’t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come forto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot OldOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many yearago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like abullock, as he means to drop you—hey?—when he come for to hearthat—hey?”In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that Iturned my face aside to save it from the flame.“Ah!” he cried, laughing, after doing it again, “the burnt child dreadsthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you wassmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick’s a match for you andknow’d you’d come to-night! Now I’ll tell you something more, wolf, andthis ends it. There’s them that’s as good a match for your uncle Provisas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him ’ware them, when he’s lost hisnevvy! Let him ’ware them, when no man can’t find a rag of his dearrelation’s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There’s them that can’tand that won’t have Magwitch,—yes, _I_ know the name!—alive in the sameland with them, and that’s had such sure information of him when he wasalive in another land, as that he couldn’t and shouldn’t leave itunbeknown and put them in danger. P’raps it’s them that writes fiftyhands, and that’s not like sneaking you as writes but one. ’WareCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!”He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for aninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced thelight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe andBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and theopposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards andforwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than everbefore, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at hissides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the picturesthat rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understandthat, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surelyperishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me whathe had told.Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed itaway. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowedslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he lookedat me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm ofhis hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence andswearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I sawin his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering onevain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, andstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that Icould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, untilthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heardresponsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at thedoor, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle ofmen, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and flyout into the night.After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in thesame place, with my head on some one’s knee. My eyes were fixed on theladder against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on it beforemy mind saw it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that Iwas in the place where I had lost it.Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain whosupported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there camebetween me and it a face. The face of Trabb’s boy!“I think he’s all right!” said Trabb’s boy, in a sober voice; “butain’t he just pale though!”At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,and I saw my supporter to be—“Herbert! Great Heaven!”“Softly,” said Herbert. “Gently, Handel. Don’t be too eager.”“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as he too bent over me.“Remember what he is going to assist us in,” said Herbert, “and becalm.”The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain inmy arm. “The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night isto-night? How long have I been here?” For, I had a strange and strongmisgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and anight,—two days and nights,—more.“The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.”“Thank God!”“And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Herbert. “Butyou can’t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Canyou stand?”“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbingarm.”They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollenand inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, theytore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefullyreplaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtainsome cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut thedoor of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through thequarry on our way back. Trabb’s boy—Trabb’s overgrown young mannow—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen comein at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when Ihad last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.The white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and asI had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which atfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remainingquiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in ourchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he hadmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I wasgone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of theinconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. Hisuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of anhour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, whovolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that hisuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, heresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at theBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time whenI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refreshthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway happened to be Trabb’sBoy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where hehad no business,—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from MissHavisham’s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb’s boy becametheir guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though bythe town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they wentalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been broughtthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’ssafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must bemischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, andwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he couldhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this waswhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether Iwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for ourimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as itwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that sucha course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might befatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and werelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For thepresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make ratherlight of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who, I am convinced, would havebeen much affected by disappointment, if he had known that hisintervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb’s boy was of amalignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that itwas in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody’sexpense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemedto meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had anill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to Londonthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then beclear away before the night’s adventure began to be talked of. Herbertgot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having thisstuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bearits pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted forto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me ofitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with themental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain uponme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged withsuch consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining fromcommunication with him that day; yet this again increased myrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believingthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell meso. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there wassomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that thefact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the dayswore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrowmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burninghead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up tohigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knewin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of afatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say tomyself with a start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,and gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with thenotion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed andthe opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bedand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep forfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the lastself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I sleptsoundly.Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winkinglights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like amarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, wasspanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and thereat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along theclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into theunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawnfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep onthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up thefire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. Ingood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted thesharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was stillflowing towards us.“When it turns at nine o’clock,” said Herbert, cheerfully, “look outfor us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”Chapter LIV.It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the windblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. Wehad our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldlypossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled thebag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, werequestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, forit was wholly set on Provis’s safety. I only wondered for the passingmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what alteredcircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as ifwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I hadtaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. Aftera little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the twoor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we wenton board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was thenabout high-water,—half-past eight.Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and beingwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those longreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river isbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, andwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which wecould choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by allnight. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam wouldstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know atwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hailthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, weshould have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of eachvessel.The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose wasso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition inwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, themovement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ranwith us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage uson,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little usein the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its presentextent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailingcolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; butof steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part somany. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here andthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was amuch easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; andwe went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with itsoyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor’s Gate, andwe were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and lookingimmensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, werecolliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging offstages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at hermoorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took goodnotice; and here to-morrow’s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit wecrossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a fasterbeating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.“Is he there?” said Herbert.“Not yet.”“Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see hissignal?”“Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see him! Pull both.Easy, Herbert. Oars!”We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvasbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.“Dear boy!” he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took hisseat. “Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!”Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rustychain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for themoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood andshaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under thefigure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds(as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firmformality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of herhead; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders’ yards, saws going attimber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leakyships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligiblesea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondentlightermen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where theships’ boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubledwaters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might flyout to the wind.At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I hadlooked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. Wecertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were noteither attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on byany boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,or to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without anyappearance of molestation.He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a naturalpart of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life hehad led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see hisgentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was notdisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had nonotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confrontedit, but it must come before he troubled himself.“If you knowed, dear boy,” he said to me, “what it is to sit herealonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by daybetwixt four walls, you’d envy me. But you don’t know what it is.”“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.“Ah,” said he, shaking his head gravely. “But you don’t know it equalto me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know itequal to me,—but I ain’t a-going to be low.”It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, heshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflectedthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all thehabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. Iwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:—“You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t’other side the world, Iwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, forall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch couldcome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody’s head would be troubled abouthim. They ain’t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,—wouldn’t be,leastwise, if they knowed where I was.”“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe againwithin a few hours.”“Well,” he returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”“And think so?”He dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—“Ay, I s’pose I think so, dear boy. We’d be puzzled to be more quietand easy-going than we are at present. But—it’s a flowing so soft andpleasant through the water, p’raps, as makes me think it—I was athinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to thebottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of thisriver what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can’t no more hold their tidethan I can hold this. And it’s run through my fingers and gone, yousee!” holding up his dripping hand.“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” saidI.“Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and ofthat there rippling at the boat’s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.Maybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.”He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression offace, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out ofEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had beenin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beerinto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought hewould be safest where he was, and he said. “Do you, dear boy?” andquietly sat down again.The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and thesunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to losenone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. Byimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more ofthe nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between themuddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within aboat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catchthe stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of alarge transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. Andsoon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were takingadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon usin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength ofthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows andmudbanks.Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drivewith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s restproved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slipperystones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. Itwas like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dimhorizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the greatfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemedstranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was roundthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and someballast-lighters, shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a boat,lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open pilesstood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakesstuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and redlandmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stageand an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us wasstagnation and mud.We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harderwork now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed androwed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us alittle, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, onthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening intoblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there werethe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, forclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we couldfind. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out foranything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four orfive dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, withher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; andwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, asthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that wewere followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregularintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one orother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here andthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a littlecreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed themnervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in alow voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we wouldfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking withwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ranalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hardby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the lightto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and Idare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a goodfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and variousliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such asthey were,” the landlord said. No other company was in the house thanthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the “Jack” of thelittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had beenlow-water mark too.With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all cameashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and allelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by thekitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startopwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air ascarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and therewere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should havethought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, theJack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoeson, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, asinteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of adrowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oaredgalley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she musthave gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when she left there.“They must ha’ thought better on’t for some reason or another,” saidthe Jack, “and gone down.”“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.“A four,” said the Jack, “and two sitters.”“Did they come ashore here?”“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I’d ha’ beenglad to pison the beer myself,” said the Jack, “or put some rattlingphysic in it.”“Why?”“_I_ know why,” said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if muchmud had washed into his throat.“He thinks,” said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a paleeye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,—“he thinks they was, whatthey wasn’t.”“_I_ knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.“_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.“I do,” said the Jack.“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”“AM I!”In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence inhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it onagain. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that hecould afford to do anything.“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,Jack?” asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.“Done with their buttons?” returned the Jack. “Chucked ’em overboard.Swallered ’em. Sowed ’em, to come up small salad. Done with theirbuttons!”“Don’t be cheeky, Jack,” remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy andpathetic way.“A Custom ’Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,” said theJack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, “whenthey comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don’tgo hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, andboth with and against another, without there being Custom ’Us at thebottom of it.” Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue thesubject.This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal windwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, andI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galleyhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was anugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had inducedProvis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startopby this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer’s time,which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put offearly in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole wedeemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an houror so of the steamer’s time, and then to get out in her track, anddrift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned intothe house and went to bed.I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for afew hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startledme. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of thewindow. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I sawtwo men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking atnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which Icould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the directionof the Nore.My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men goingaway. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the backof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harderday than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, Icould see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, Isoon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of thematter, and fell asleep again.We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, beforebreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again ourcharge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that themen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had nothought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk awaytogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should takeus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at aboutnoon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast heand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap meon the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was indanger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. Aswe approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men hadpassed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was noboat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor werethere any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, thetide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that Iwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes movingabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We gotaboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By thattime it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look outfor her smoke.But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwardswe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming onat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity ofsaying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken handscordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when Isaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little wayahead of us, and row out into the same track.A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s smoke,by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before thetide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis tosit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, “Trust tome, dear boy,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which wasvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, andfallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke ortwo when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, andlooked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter waswrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper someinstruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken ineither boat.Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face.She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grewlouder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,when the galley hailed us. I answered.“You have a returned Transport there,” said the man who held the lines.“That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,and you to assist.”At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden strokeahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding onto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused greatconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, andheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, butfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I sawthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner’s shoulder,and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quitefrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of theshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw thatthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a whiteterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on boardthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sinkfrom under me.It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousandmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I wastaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off ofher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at firstdistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of thegalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strongstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently andeagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held uphis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight andtrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacledat the wrists and ankles.The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the waterwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently notunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she hadbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, andwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-outwas kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers weregone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavernwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis nolonger,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and adeep cut in the head.He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of thesteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury tohis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thoughthe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he didnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identifyhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they hadboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep himin it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone downfiercely locked in each other’s arms, and that there had been astruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,and swum away.I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus toldme. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of theirgoing overboard.When I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s wetclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at thepublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must takecharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-bookwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer’s. He furthergave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined toaccord that grace to my two friends.The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gonedown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it waslikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me tobe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, ittook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that mayhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were invarious stages of decay.We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and thenMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert andStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had adoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side, I feltthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a manwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through aseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been toJoe.His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the armI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that Icould not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it wasunquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could notdoubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who hadbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since brokenprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportationunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man whowas the cause of his arrest.As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him howgrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.“Dear boy,” he answered, “I’m quite content to take my chance. I’veseen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.”No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick’s hint now.I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited tothe Crown.“Lookee here, dear boy,” said he “It’s best as a gentleman should notbe knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come bychance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, forthe last o’ many times, and I don’t ask no more.”“I will never stir from your side,” said I, “when I am suffered to benear you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!”I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away ashe lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in histhroat,—softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thingthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I mightnot otherwise have thought of until too late,—that he need never knowhow his hopes of enriching me had perished.Chapter LV.He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have beenimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send downfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who hadmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happenedthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who couldgive the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at hisprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, andMr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing. It was thesole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in fiveminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth couldprevent its going against us.I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of thefate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me forhaving “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialiseby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not concealfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which theforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in thiscase to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was notrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before hisapprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and Ifinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that myheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting toestablish one.There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer hadhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained someaccurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs. When his body was found, manymiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that hewas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were stilllegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of abanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and thedesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads ofinformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. Hisignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted butthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’s aid.After three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood overfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witnesscame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trialat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home oneevening, a good deal cast down, and said,—“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than hethought.“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I amvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”“Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; butmy need is no greater now than at another time.”“You will be so lonely.”“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I. “You know that I amalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that Ishould be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away fromhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.”The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling toboth of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.“My dear fellow,” said Herbert, “let the near prospect of ourseparation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling youabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?”“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it mustnot be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a fewfriendly words go, with me.”“I will,” said I.“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—”I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “Aclerk.”“A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as aclerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,Handel,—in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?”There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner inwhich after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave beginning ofa portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.“Clara and I have talked about it again and again,” Herbert pursued,“and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears inher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we cometogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince herhusband’s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,Handel!”I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I couldnot yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, mymind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.Secondly,—Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in mythoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.“But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injuryto your business, leave the question open for a little while—”“For any while,” cried Herbert. “Six months, a year!”“Not so long as that,” said I. “Two or three months at most.”Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he mustgo away at the end of the week.“And Clara?” said I.“The dear little thing,” returned Herbert, “holds dutifully to herfather as long as he lasts; but he won’t last long. Mrs. Whimpleconfides to me that he is certainly going.”“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.”“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert; “and then I shallcome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and Iwill walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blesseddarling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into thered book, and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune forthe son of my mother!”On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full ofbright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as he sat on one of theseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little noteto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over andover again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name;for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after anunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen himalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he hadcome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words ofexplanation in reference to that failure.“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little got atthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it wasfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his peoplebeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and Ithought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can onlysuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,habitually to deceive his own instruments. You don’t blame me, I hope,Mr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.”“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you mostearnestly for all your interest and friendship.”“Thank you, thank you very much. It’s a bad job,” said Wemmick,scratching his head, “and I assure you I haven’t been so cut up for along time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portableproperty. Dear me!”“What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick. “Of course, there can be no objectionto your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound note myselfto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeysonhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, andbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could havebeen saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have beensaved. That’s the difference between the property and the owner, don’tyou see?”I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass ofgrog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While hewas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead upto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?”“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick. “Yes. I’m going totake a holiday. More than that; I’m going to take a walk. More thanthat; I’m going to ask you to take a walk with me.”I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,when Wemmick anticipated me.“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts,Mr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one. Say it might occupy you(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn’t youstretch a point and manage it?”He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very littleto do for him. I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and he was sovery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At hisparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at halfpast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Mondaymorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as lookingtighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were twoglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must havebeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of hisbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, andwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I wasconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put itover his shoulder. “Why, we are not going fishing!” said I. “No,”returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We wenttowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick saidsuddenly,—“Halloa! Here’s a church!”There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rathersurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,—“Let’s go in!”We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and lookedall round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,and getting something out of paper there.“Halloa!” said he. “Here’s a couple of pair of gloves! Let’s put ’emon!”As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widenedto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. Theywere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a sidedoor, escorting a lady.“Halloa!” said Wemmick. “Here’s Miss Skiffins! Let’s have a wedding.”That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was nowengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. TheAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for thealtar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so muchdifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary toput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind thepillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the oldgentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and saferesistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on toperfection.The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order atthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all withoutpreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something outof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa! Here’s aring!”I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made afeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility ofgiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to theclergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” theold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony wehad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.Upon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to bemarried to this man?” The old gentleman being still in a state of mostestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomedvoice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged repliedwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, “All right, John,all right, my boy!” And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause uponit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completelymarried that day.It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of churchWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,and put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. “_Now_, Mr.Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we cameout, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be awedding-party!”Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or soaway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelleboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds afterthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longerunwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat ina high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might havedone.We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything ontable, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; don’t be afraidof it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to theCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as Icould.Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands withhim, and wished him joy.“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. “She’s such a manager offowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge foryourself. I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low. “This isaltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”“I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.Wemmick nodded. “After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers mayas well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, orsomething of the kind.”Chapter LVI.He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between hiscommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had brokentwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with greatpain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of hishurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spokevery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became thefirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew heought to hear.Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, afterthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities ofbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for hisillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as adetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, theregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to recordon his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. Ido not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; hewasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the daywhen the prison door closed upon him.The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a manwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manneror from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he ponderedover the question whether he might have been a better man under bettercircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending thatway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that hisdesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people inattendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned hiseyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I hadseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I wasa little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and Inever knew him complain.When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to bemade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. Itwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to thebar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my gettingclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that hestretched forth to me.The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be saidfor him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and hadthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact thathe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. Itwas impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find himguilty.At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terribleexperience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passingof Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence ofDeath. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holdsbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, thatI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive thatsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glitteringin the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outsideit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men andwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing andweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. Therehad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had beenstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chainsand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a greatgallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as thetwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judgeaddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he mustsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy hadbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonmentsand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term ofyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, hadmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserableman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, whenfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived apeaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to thosepropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long renderedhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest andrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evadingthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act offlight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by expressdesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of hisdenouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishmentfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and hiscase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through theglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft oflight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth allthings, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of facein this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received mysentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat downagain. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he hadto say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some ofthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggardlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or threeshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they hadtaken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because ofhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he heldmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience gotup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at himand me.I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’sReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began thatnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, settingforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for mysake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when Ihad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such menin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to theCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I tookno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbedin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep awayfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopefuland less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonablerestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, andtheir long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was morestrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of anintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before Isat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of thesingleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. Therewas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officeralways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sickprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them assick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God bethanked!) always joined in the same report.As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidlylooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his faceuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it wouldsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, thenhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew tounderstand his meaning very well.The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change inhim than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, andlighted up as I entered.“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was late.But I knowed you couldn’t be that.”“It is just the time,” said I. “I waited for it at the gate.”“You always waits at the gate; don’t you, dear boy?”“Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.”“Thank’ee dear boy, thank’ee. God bless you! You’ve never deserted me,dear boy.”I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had oncemeant to desert him.“And what’s the best of all,” he said, “you’ve been more comfortablealonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.That’s best of all.”He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, anda film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.“Are you in much pain to-day?”“I don’t complain of none, dear boy.”“You never do complain.”He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch tomean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laidit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, Ifound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,“You needn’t go yet.” I thanked him gratefully, and asked, “Might Ispeak to him, if he can hear me?”The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placidlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.“Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what Isay?”A gentle pressure on my hand.“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.”A stronger pressure on my hand.“She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is alady and very beautiful. And I love her!”With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for myyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lyingon it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,and his head dropped quietly on his breast.Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two menwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no betterwords that I could say beside his bed, than “O Lord, be merciful to hima sinner!”Chapter LVII.Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention toquit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legallydetermine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put billsup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, andbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I oughtrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy andconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truthbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon mehad enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew thatit was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was evencareless as to that.For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,—anywhere,according as I happened to sink down,—with a heavy head and achinglimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night whichappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, Ifound I could not do so.Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of thenight, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whetherI had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with greatterror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had foundmyself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming upthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had beeninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, andgroaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of myown making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a darkcorner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that Itried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay thatmorning on my bed. But the vapour of a limekiln would come between meand them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at lastthat I saw two men looking at me.“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don’t know you.”“Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on theshoulder, “this is a matter that you’ll soon arrange, I dare say, butyou’re arrested.”“What is the debt?”“Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller’s account, Ithink.”“What is to be done?”“You had better come to my house,” said the man. “I keep a very nicehouse.”I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended tothem, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. Istill lay there.“You see my state,” said I. “I would come with you if I could; butindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall dieby the way.”Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me tobelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in mymemory by only this one slender thread, I don’t know what they did,except that they forbore to remove me.That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that Ioften lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that Iconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was abrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from thegiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of avast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I imploredin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammeredoff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my ownremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimesstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, andthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, andwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay medown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was aconstant tendency in all these people,—who, when I was very ill, wouldpresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,and would be much dilated in size,—above all, I say, I knew that therewas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, tosettle down into the likeness of Joe.After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to noticethat while all its other features changed, this one consistent featuredid not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. Iopened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at thebedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on thewindow-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I sawJoe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me wasJoe’s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face thatlooked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “_Is_ it Joe?”And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”“O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tellme of my ingratitude. Don’t be so good to me!”For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, andput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever friends.And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his backtowards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented mefrom getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering,“O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!”Joe’s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holdinghis hand, and we both felt happy.“How long, dear Joe?”“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear oldchap?”“Yes, Joe.”“It’s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.”“And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?”“Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of yourbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a dealof walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,and marriage were the great wish of his hart—”“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what yousaid to Biddy.”“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be amongst strangers,and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such amoment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, ‘Goto him, without loss of time.’ That,” said Joe, summing up with hisjudicial air, “were the word of Biddy. ‘Go to him,’ Biddy say, ‘withoutloss of time.’ In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive you,” Joe added,after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the wordof that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s loss of time.’”There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked toin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment atstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and thatI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and layquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love init.Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking athim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see thepride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of itscurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, asthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and theroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my ownwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from thepen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up hissleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It wasnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it mighthave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his penspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was onthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen intospace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he wastripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole hegot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and hadremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head withhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying theeffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,with unbounded satisfaction.Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able totalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. Heshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.“Is she dead, Joe?”“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and byway of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,for that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t—”“Living, Joe?”“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”“Did she linger long, Joe?”“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if youwas put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account, tocome at everything by degrees.“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the mostof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she hadwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore theaccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousandunto him? ‘Because of Pip’s account of him, the said Matthew.’ I amtold by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legalturn as if it did him infinite good, “‘account of him the saidMatthew.’ And a cool four thousand, Pip!”I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperatureof the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of moneymore to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its beingcool.This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing Ihad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the otherrelations had any legacies?“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur tobuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twentypound down. Mrs.—what’s the name of them wild beasts with humps, oldchap?”“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.Joe nodded. “Mrs. Camels,” by which I presently understood he meantCamilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her inspirits when she wake up in the night.”The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to giveme great confidence in Joe’s information. “And now,” said Joe, “youain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor oneadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open adwelling-ouse.”“Whose?” said I.“Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” saidJoe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, andcastles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time. And wotsume’erthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.”“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took hiscash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied himup to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed hismouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But heknowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slowto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joestayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,that I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me inthe old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the oldunassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all mylife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troublesof the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except thehousehold work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, afterpaying off the laundress on his first arrival. “Which I do assure you,Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found hera tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off thefeathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,and draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying awaythe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and thewine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we hadonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the daycame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I werestill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given ofthe wealth of his great nature.And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to beSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought howit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had beenforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day andby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burningand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossedthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sundaybells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, Ifelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet tobe even that,—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid itlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was toomuch for my young senses.More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used totalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no changewhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in myeyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me—soeasily!—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventfulChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yetmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much ofmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myselfnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myselfwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon furtherconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patronwas?”“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’ youthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”“So it was.”“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way.“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, withincreasing diffidence.“Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”“Yes.”“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking ratherevasively at the window-seat, “as I _did_ hear tell that how he weresomething or another in a general way in that direction.”“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”“Not partickler, Pip.”“If you would like to hear, Joe—” I was beginning, when Joe got up andcame to my sofa.“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me. “Ever the best offriends; ain’t us, Pip?”I was ashamed to answer him.“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; “that’s all right;that’s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which asbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There’s subjects enoughas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of yourpoor sister and her Rampages! And don’t you remember Tickler?”“I do indeed, Joe.”“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe. “I done what I could to keep you andTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to myinclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, itwere not so much,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, “thatshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but thatshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain’t agrab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which yoursister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a littlechild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped intoheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally upand says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant youI see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the good. I call uponyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.’”“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.“The man says,” Joe assented. “Is he right, that man?”“Dear Joe, he is always right.”“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words. If he’s alwaysright (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when hesays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, whenyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J.Gargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equalto his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt twosech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddygiv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almostawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in thislight, as I should so put it. Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmedwith his logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a truefriend, say. Namely. You mustn’t go a overdoing on it, but you musthave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixtthe sheets.”The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tactand kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me outso soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. Butwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had alldissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could notunderstand.Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began todevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehensionof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little lesseasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dearfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears. I too hadfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them beganto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began tounderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it wasall mine.Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think thatin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I givenJoe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I gotstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had betterloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in theTemple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in him veryplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking atthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,—“See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk backby myself.”“Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur tosee you able, sir.”The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked nofurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weakerthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but wasthoughtful.I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growingchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That Iwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had comedown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was notquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his littlesavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that Imust not suffer him to do it.It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went tobed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow beingSunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week. On Mondaymorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside thislast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to goout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As Icleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympatheticallyarrived at a resolution too.We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, andthen walked in the fields.“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said.“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned.“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There weredays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shallforget these.”“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there hasbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.”At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had doneall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as wellas in the morning?“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, andsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full ofmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him beforebreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, andhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. Thesewere its brief contents:—“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dearPip and will do better withoutJO.“P.S. Ever the best of friends.”Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which Ihad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that mycreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should bequite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe’s having paid the money;but Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, andthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrancewith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reservedSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in mythoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her howhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lostall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences inmy first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, “Biddy, I think youonce liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayedaway from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has beensince. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can takeme with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you canreceive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, andhave as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I ama little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little. And,Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forgewith Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down inthis country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where anopportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until Iknew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you willgo through the world with me, you will surely make it a better worldfor me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it abetter world for you.”Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down tothe old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all Ihave left to tell.Chapter LVIII.The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down tomy native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found theBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made agreat change in the Boar’s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivatedmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going outof property.It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had sooften made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), andcould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons andpost-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging asin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, andthe quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolledround by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bitsof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction ofthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was tobe sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked inwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part ofthe main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots weremarked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torndown to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low inthe dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the opengate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a strangerwho had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on thecasks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had sooften pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I found Mr.Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improvedin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, andaddressed me in the following terms:—“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could beexpected! what else could be expected!”As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as Iwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.And has it come to this! Has it come to this!”I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over meand poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of abenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on. Inhappier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar? And did youtake milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.”“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding hishead several times, as if he might have expected that, and as ifabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “True.The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn’t bring any, William.”I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to standover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. “Andyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spreadafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!”This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile mannerin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?”and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited thesame fat five fingers.“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread and butter. “And air youa-going to Joseph?”“In heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does itmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.”It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechookthe opportunity he wanted.“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article inquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for thebehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I _will_ leave thatteapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. Iforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as towish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects ofprodigygality, to be stimilated by the ’olesome nourishment of yourforefathers. And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord andwaiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I eversported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; Itell you this is him!”A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to beparticularly affected.“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart. Thisis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sisterof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M’ria fromher own mother, let him deny it if he can!”The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gavethe case a black look.“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the oldfashion, “you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you askme, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going toJoseph.”The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air ofsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing andconclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires ofthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here isWilliam, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceivemyself.”“You do not, sir,” said William.“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young man,what to say to Joseph. Says you, “Joseph, I have this day seen myearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s. I will name nonames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I haveseen that man.”“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I.“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook. “Say you said that, and evenJoseph will probably betray surprise.”“There you quite mistake him,” said I. “I know better.”“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “‘Joseph, I have seen that man, andthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows yourcharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness andignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want ofgratitoode. Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his headand hand at me, “‘he knows my total deficiency of common humangratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the faceto talk thus to mine.“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will nowrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger ofProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw itplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode tohis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s_. But that man said hedid not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right todo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he woulddo it again.’”“It’s pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interruptedbreakfast, “that the man did not say what he had done and would doagain.”“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,“and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up townor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to doit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.”With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted bythe virtues of that same indefinite “it.” I was not long after him inleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw himholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to aselect group, who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as Ipassed on the opposite side of the way.But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whosegreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, formy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drewnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulnessfurther and further behind.The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks weresoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside morebeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Manypleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of thechange for the better that would come over my character when I had aguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom Ihad proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; formy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,and whose wanderings had lasted many years.The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, thelittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness’sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was aholiday; no children were there, and Biddy’s house was closed. Somehopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards itunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer.Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied Iheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, andtheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, theclink of Joe’s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, Isaw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, noglittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, andstill.But the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be inuse, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and thewindow was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaningto peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm inarm.At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, butin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and shewept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,because I looked so worn and white.“But dear Biddy, how smart you are!”“Yes, dear Pip.”“And Joe, how smart _you_ are!”“Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.”I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then—“It’s my wedding-day!” cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, “and I ammarried to Joe!”They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on theold deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe’srestoring touch was on my shoulder. “Which he warn’t strong enough, mydear, fur to be surprised,” said Joe. And Biddy said, “I ought to havethought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.” They were both sooverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming tothem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make theirday complete!My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had neverbreathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with mein my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have beenhis knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!“Dear Biddy,” said I, “you have the best husband in the whole world,and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have—But no, youcouldn’t love him better than you do.”“No, I couldn’t indeed,” said Biddy.“And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she willmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, nobleJoe!”Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve beforehis eyes.“And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are incharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all youhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that Iam going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that Ishall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you havekept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don’t think, dear Joeand Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose Icould cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so ifI could!”They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say nomore.“But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winternight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it forever. Don’t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don’t tell him, Biddy,that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured youboth, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than Idid.”“I ain’t a-going,” said Joe, from behind his sleeve, “to tell himnothink o’ that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain’t. Nor yet no one ain’t.”“And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kindhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear yousay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, andthen I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think betterof me, in the time to come!”“O dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe. “God knows as I forgive you, if Ihave anythink to forgive!”“Amen! And God knows I do!” echoed Biddy.“Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a fewminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, gowith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we saygood-bye!”I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a compositionwith my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and Iwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, andwithin two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within fourmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam acrossthe parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble underold Bill Barley’s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away tomarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch untilhe brought her back.Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I livedhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid mydebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. Itwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me toHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert’s partnershiphad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So hetold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellowand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must notleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that wemade mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we hada good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed somuch to Herbert’s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I oftenwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until Iwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitudehad never been in him at all, but had been in me.Chapter LIX.For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodilyeyes,—though they had both been often before my fancy in theEast,—when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, Ilaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched itso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smokinghis pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and asstrong as ever, though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced intothe corner with Joe’s leg, and sitting on my own little stool lookingat the fire, was—I again!“We giv’ him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,” said Joe,delighted, when I took another stool by the child’s side (but I did_not_ rumple his hair), “and we hoped he might grow a little bit likeyou, and we think he do.”I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and wetalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I tookhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to thememory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wifeof the Above.“Biddy,” said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her littlegirl lay sleeping in her lap, “you must give Pip to me one of thesedays; or lend him, at all events.”“No, no,” said Biddy, gently. “You must marry.”“So Herbert and Clara say, but I don’t think I shall, Biddy. I have sosettled down in their home, that it’s not at all likely. I am alreadyquite an old bachelor.”Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips,and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it intomine. There was something in the action, and in the light pressure ofBiddy’s wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.“Dear Pip,” said Biddy, “you are sure you don’t fret for her?”“O no,—I think not, Biddy.”“Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?“My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had aforemost place there, and little that ever had any place there. Butthat poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,—allgone by!”Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretlyintended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, forher sake. Yes, even so. For Estella’s sake.I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as beingseparated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, andwho had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice,brutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband,from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. Thisrelease had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew,she was married again.The early dinner hour at Joe’s, left me abundance of time, withouthurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to thinkof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but thewall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with arough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy hadstruck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. Agate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yetup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and themoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out whereevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and waslooking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figurein it.The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been movingtowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be thefigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,when it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as ifmuch surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,—“Estella!”“I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.”The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribablemajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before wasthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many years,it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where ourfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?”“I have never been here since.”“Nor I.”The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the whiteceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thoughtof the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he hadheard on earth.Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.“I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have beenprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!”The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, andthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowingthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, shesaid quietly,—“Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left inthis condition?”“Yes, Estella.”“The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have notrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but Ihave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance Imade in all the wretched years.”“Is it to be built on?”“At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. Andyou,” she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,—“youlive abroad still?”“Still.”“And do well, I am sure?”“I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore—yes, I dowell.”“I have often thought of you,” said Estella.“Have you?”“Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far fromme the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorantof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with theadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.”“You have always held your place in my heart,” I answered.And we were silent again until she spoke.“I little thought,” said Estella, “that I should take leave of you intaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.”“Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful andpainful.”“But you said to me,” returned Estella, very earnestly, “‘God blessyou, God forgive you!’ And if you could say that to me then, you willnot hesitate to say that to me now,—now, when suffering has beenstronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand whatyour heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into abetter shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell mewe are friends.”“We are friends,” said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose fromthe bench.“And will continue friends apart,” said Estella.I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, asthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, sothe evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse oftranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another partingfrom her.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GREAT EXPECTATIONS ***Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.
